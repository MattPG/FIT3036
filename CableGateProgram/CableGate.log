REF: STATE 106206 CIRCULAR; STATE CA-3400 NOV 2, 1966 
 
 
1.  PRESS REPORTS AND VARIETY EMBASSY SOURCES CONFIRM 
NEW ARGENTINE LEGISLATION UNILATERALLY CHANGING SEAS JURIS- 
DICTION NOW UNDER ADVANCED REVIEW.  REPORTEDLY LAW WOULD 
ESTABLISH SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA, PLUS ANOTHER SIX MILES 
OF EXCLUSIVE FISHING JURISDICTION, PLUS ANOTHER EXTENDED ZONE 
OF \"PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION\" FOR FISHING PURPOSES.  DRAFT- 
LAW UNDER CONSIDERATION IN ARGENTINE SENATE BEFORE JUNE 28 
COUP WOULD HAVE DEFINED ZONE OF PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION 
AS \"EPICONTINENTAL SEA OUT TO 200 METER ISOBAR\".  IN SOUTHERN 
ARGENTINA THIS ZONE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES WIDE AND BLANKETS 
FALKLAND ISLANDS. 
 
2.  NAVATT STATES ARGENTINE NAVY THINKING OF PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION OUT TO 200 MILES (AS IN PERU, ECUADOR, CHILE) 
RATHER THAN EPICONTINENTAL SEA.  200 MILE LIMIT DOES NOT 
RPT NOT REACH FALKLANDS.  ARGENTINE NAVY OFF TOLD NAVATT 
\"200 MILE LIMIT SOON WILL BE STANDARD THROUGH HEMISPHERE\". 
 
3.  FONOFF OFFICIALS REFERRING TO RECENT BRAZILIAN AND US 
LEGISLATION HAVE INFORMALLY INDICATED DECISION ALREADY 
FINAL RE SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA PLUS SIX MILE EXCLUSIVE 
FISHING JURISDICTION, BUT THAT \"PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION\" 
STILL UNDER STUDY.  TWO FONOFF MEN VOLUNTARILY AND INFORMALLY 
SOUGHT EMBASSY REACTION TO POSSIBLE EXTENDED PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION BY SUGGESTING THAT US IN FACT HAS ACCEPTED 
UNILATERALLY CREATED ECUADORIAN, PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN 200 MILE 
LIMITS.  EMBOFF REJECTED IDEA US ACCEPTS THESE LIMITS IN ANY 
WAY AND POINTED OUT 1965 AMENDMENTS TO AID LEGISLATION AIMED 
AT FURTHER PROTECTING US FISHING RIGHTS. 
 
4.  FONOFF LEGAL ADVISOR CONCEDES DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
\"EXCLUSIVE\" AND \"PREFERENTIAL\" FISHING JURISDICTION A SEMANTIC 
NICETY.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ZONE OF \"PREFERENTIAL\" JURIS- 
DICTION ARGENTINA WOULD CLAIM RIGHT TO TAX, LICENSE AND OTHER- 
WISE CONTROL ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EXPLOITATION OF 
RESOURCES OF SEA. 
 
5.  DRAFT LEGISLATION ON SEAS JURISDICTION LAY DORMANT UNTIL 
SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL IN FISHIN ARGENTINE EPICONTINENTAL SEAS 
BY CUBAN AND EAST EUROPEAN (ESPECIALLY SOVIET) VESSELS PAST 
SIX MONTHS ALARMED ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES.  (SEE NAVATT IR 
5-804-0-140-66 OF NOV 18) NOT RPT NOT ALL SOVIET VESSELS WERE 
FISHING OR FACTORY TYPES.  FONOFF SOURCES INFORMALLY STATE 
ARMED FORCES PRESSURE MAKES EMISSION NEW LAW IMPERATIVE, QUITE 
POSSIBLY APPEARING WITHIN NEXT FEW WEEKS.  WHEN ASKED BY FONOFF 
MEN ABOUT \"SECURITY PROBLEMS CREATED BY SOVIET TRAWLERS OFF US 
COAST\", EMBASSY OFF REPLIED US DID NOT RPT NOT SEE THAT 
UNILATERAL ATTEMPT TO EXTEND SEAS JURISDICTION OFFERED ANY 
REALISTIC SOLUTION FOR POSSIBLE SECURITY PROBLEMS, WHILE SUCH 
ACTION COULD CREATE NEW SOURCES POSSIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING AND 
CONFLICT. 
 
6.  RE PAR 3 STATE 106206 BELIEVE OUTLINED PROPOSAL MIGHT 
FORESTALL UNILATERAL ARGENTINE ATTEMPT TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXTEND 
\"PREFERENTIAL\" FISHING JURISDICTION ONLY IF EMBASSY CAN BE 
AUTHORIZED DISCUSS IDEA WITH ARGENTINES IMMEDIATELY. EVEN THEN 
CHANCES SUCCESS LIMITED BY (A) ADVANCED STAGE PROPOSED ARGENTINE 
LAW AND (B) PRIMACY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ARGENTINE THINKING. 
WE WOULD BENEFIT SOME FROM FONOFF LEGAL ADVISORS\' QUALMS ABOUT 
UNILATERAL ACTION, AND FROM RESTRAINT OF RECENT BRAZILIAN 
LEGISLATION WHICH DID NOT RPT NOT GO BEYOND 12-MILE LIMIT. 
 
7.  FOR DISCUSSION WITH ARGENTINES WOULD MODIFY TEXT IN STATE 
10942 CIRCULAR TO:  (A) MAKE ALL REFERENCES TO ARGENTINA, VICE 
CANADA; (B) REFER TO PROPOSED ARGENTINE CLAIMS OF PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION OVER WATERS WE REGARD AS HIGH SEAS; (C) ELIMINATE 
REFERENCES TO \"TRADITIONAL DISTANT WATER FISHERIES\", SINCE 
ARGENTINE COAST NOT RPT NOT TRADITIONAL FISHING ZONE (WHEREAS 
NO. 3);  (D) ADD NOTATION THERE NO TRADITIONAL FISHING AND 
CONFINE OPERATIVE AGREEMENT TO PROVISIONS FOR NON-TRADITIONAL 
FISHING; (E) ELIMINATE LAST THREE PARS OF AIDE-MEMOIRE HANDED 
TO CANADIAN AMB. 
 
8.  IF AUTHORIZED, ENVISAGE TWO-STEP APPROACH TO FONOFF. 
FIRST, INFORMAL AND ORAL, STRESSING OUR INTEREST IN FREEDOM OF 
HIGH SEAS, NOTING EARLIER FONOFF CONFIRMATION NEW LAW UNDER 
STUDY, OUTLINING OUR PROPOSAL IN GENERAL TERMS.  ON BASIS 
FONOFF REACTION, WE WOULD THEN COUCH AIDE-MEMOIRE IN TERMS 
WHICH WOULD APPEAR MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED.

REF: TEHRAN 1091: TEHRAN 263: MOSCOW 1603 
 
COUNTRY TEAM. MESSAGE 
 
 
BEGIN SUMMARY 
 
GENERAL AZIMI, MINISTER OF WAR, ON INSTRUCTION OF SHAH ASKS THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER HARD LOOK AT F-4E PRODUCTION LINE IN ORDER ACCELERATE DELIVERY OF ONE SQUADRON OF F-4ES TO IRAN IN 1972. REQUEST REFLECTS SHAH\'S INCREASING CONCERN OVER SOVIET AMBITIONS IN AREA AND ESPECIALLY THREAT SHAH SEES TO IRAN OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY IRAQ AND USSR. SHAH RECOGNIZES PROBLEMS THIS POSES FOR US BUT IS TURNING TO USG WITH THIS REQUEST TO GIVE IRAN HIGHER PRIORITY ON FA-4E PRODUCTION SCHEDULE BECAUSE HE REGARDS US AS MOST DEPENDABLE FRIEND. END SUMMARY 
 
ACTION REQUESTED: COUNTRY TEAM RECOMMENDS US REVIEW F-4E PRODUCTION LINE AND RESPOND FAVORABLY TO SHAH\'S REQUEST FOR 16 F-4ES IN 1972 FROM WHATEVER SOURCE MAY BE AVAILABLE. 
 
1. ON FEB 24 CHARGE WAS CONVOKED BY MINSTER OF WAR, GEN. REZANUZIMI, ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM SHAH. AZIMI SAID SHAH MOST DEEPLY CONCERNED AT TRENDS IN SECURITY SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST AND EXPECIALLY ON HIS WESTERN BORDERS. US OFFICALS ALREADY AWARE OF SHAH\'S CONCERN THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER AND OTHER GOI OFFICIALS (SEE REFTELS), BUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ SOVIET RELATIONS INCLUDING AGREEMENT TO DELIVER MORE MIGS AND OTHER MILITARY EQUIPMENT PLUS INDICATION THAT RECENT IRAQI-SOVIET TALKS IN MOSCOW INCLUDED CONSIDERATION OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY AS WELL AS INCREASED MILITARY COOPERATION INJECT NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN SHAH\'S TIMETABLE FOR MODERNINZING AND STRENTHENING HIS ARMED FORCES. MOST SPECIFICALLY, SITUATION REQUIRED IRAN ACCELERATE ITS MILITARY PROCUREMENT AND HOST PARTICULARLY DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT. 
 
2. AZIMI RECALLED THAT GOI HAD REQUESTED DELIVERY OF 16 OF F-4E AIRCRAFT NOW ON ORDER BY IRAN (FIRST OF WHICH WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY UNTIL AUGUST 1973) BE ADVANCED TO CY 1972. HOWEVER, GOI HAD RECENTLY BEEN INFORMED BY USG AND MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS THAT PRODUCTION LINE FOR IRAN COULD NOT RPT NOT BE ADVANCED TO MEET 1972 DELIVERY DATES DESIRED. SHAH WAS MOST DISTURBED, AS ADDITION OF F-4ES IN 1972 WAS VITAL TO IRAN\'S SECURITY AT THIS TIME. SHAH HAD DIRECTED THAT USG BE ASKED, IF PRODUCTION FOR IRAN COULD NOT IN FACT BE ADVANCED, TO MAKE REQUESTED F-4ES AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. SHAH\'S DESIRE IS FOR DELIIVERY OF F-4FS IN LOTS OF FOUR DURING JUNE TO DECEMBER TIME-FRAME. 
 
3. CHARGE REVIEWED RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN US-IRAN MILITARY COOPERATION, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT AND CREDIT, AND STRESSED THAT RECORD INDICATED WE UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED SHAH\'S CONCERNS AND DESIRES AND HAD BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY RESPONSIVE TO SHAH\'S WISHES. CURRENTLY, AZIMI\'S DEPUTY GEN. TOUFANS, WAS IN US DISCUSSING VERY QUESTION OF ACCLERATED EQUIPMENT ACQUISIION INCLUDING F-4E. ACCELERATION OF F-4E DELIVERY RAISED DIFFICULT TECHNICAL AND COST PROBLEMS AS WELL AS QUESTIONS OF OTHER COMMITMENTS AND PRIORITIES. UNDOUBTEDLY THESE ISSUES WERE BEING DISCUSSED IN FULL WITH GEN. TOUFANIAN TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY INFORMED OF POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS AND REASONS FOR ANY LIMITATIONS ON MEETING GOI REQUEST THAT MIGHT EXIST. GEN. TOUFANIAN PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FULLER PICTURE OF SITUATION THAN WE NOW HAD IN IRAN. 
 
4. AZIMI RESPONDED THAT GOI WAS BEING KEPT INFORMED OF TOUFANIAN DISCUSSIONS, BUT DECISON ON F-4E COULD NOT BE DELAYED. AZIMI MADE CLEAR SHAH FELT AQUISITION OF 16 F-4E AIRCRAFT IN 1972 WAS MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE MILITARY PROBLEM OUTSTANDING. HE STRESSED SHAH BELIEVED THAT NUMBER REQUIRED WAS SMALL IN RELATION TO US INVENTORY, AND THAT UNSETTLED SITUATION CONFRONTING IRAN WARRANTED ACCELERATED DELIVERY TO IRAN AS AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE DISPOSITIONS (AS TO EUROPE OR EVEN USAF) IN SAME TIME FRAME. 
 
5. CHARGE NOTED WE WOULD TRANSMIT SHAHS REQUEST TO, WASHINGTON AND THAT USG IN SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH MARKED OUR RELATIONS WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE RESPONSIVE. CHARGE SAID THIS SAME FRIENDSHIP REQUIRED HIM TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH WE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MEET SHAH\'S NEEDS AS SHAH SAW THEM, OUR MILITARY ADVISERS, AS GOI KNEW, WERE CONCERNED THAT ACCELERATION OF AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION WOULD STRAIN SUPPORT AND OPERATIONAL MANPOWER OF IIAF AND COULD LEAD TO DECREASE RATHER THAN INCREASE IN IIAF EFFECTIVENESS. AZIMI REPLIED THAT NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED HAD BEEN, CLOSELY STUDIED BY IlAF WITH MAAG ASSISTANCE, AND IIAF WAS SATISFIED THAT SIXTEEN AIRCRAFT REQUESTED COULD BE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED INTO PRESENT FORCE STRUCTURE. AZIMI CLOSED MEETING BY ASKING THAT USG ANSWER SHAH\'S REQUEST AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. 
 
6. COMMENT. SHAH IS DEEPLY CONCERN AT DEVELOPMENTS OVER PAST YEARS STRENGTHENING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND PRESENCE IN MIDEAST AND INDIAN OCEAN AND APPEARING TO INDICATE SUBSTANTIALLY ENLARGED SOVIET COMMITMENT, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY, TO IRAQ. HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT INCREASED PRESENT DANGER REQIRES IRAN\'S FIRST LINE AIR DEFENSE TO BE BEEFED-UP NOW RATHER THAN IN PREVIOUSLY PROGRAMMED SCHEDULE STARTING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THE NUMBER, FREQUENCY AND TONE OF DEMARCHES ON SUBJECT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS VIRTUALLY UNPARALLELLED, AND CAN LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT HIM CONSIDERS ISSUE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE. 
 
7. WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH SHAH\'S CONCERN, WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT REQUEST --LIKE USG DECISION IN 1970 ON SALE TO IRAN OF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH SQUADRONS OF F-4E --HAS BECOME ANOTHER GUT ISSUE IN SHAH\'S MIND. SHAH IS AGAIN TURNING TO USG BECAUSE IN PERIODS OF ANXIETY SHAH FEELS HE CAN LOOK TO US FOR COOPERATION AND HE HOPES THAT US AS RELIABLE FRIEND WILL FIND CHANCE BE RESPONSIVE ON MATTER HE CONSIDERS IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO IRAN\'S SECURITY. THUS USG CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST MUST RECOGNIZE THAT DECISION INVOLVES UNUSUAL DEGREE OF POLITICAL IMPORTANCE RELATED TO FABRIC OF USG-GOI RELATIONS. DECISION SHOULD ALSO NOT OVERLOOK OR UNDERESTIMATE IMPORTANCE OF IRAN FOR VITAL US NATIONAL INTERESTS. 
 
8. ACTION REQUESTED. COUNRY TEAM URGES THAT USG GIVE PROMPT AND SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION TO SHAH\'S REQUEST FOR 1972 DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT, FROM WHATEVER SOURCES MAY BE AVAILABLE TO BE TAPPED (INCLUDING DELIVERIES TO USAF). WE RECOGNIZE THAT REQUEST MAY RAISE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS, BUT URGE THAT EVERY AVENUE BE EXPLORED TO REACH POSITIVE RESPONSE. IT IS ALSO MOST IMPORTANT THAT COUNTRY TEAM BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED OF PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS TO ENABLE US CONTINUE TO MEET AND TEMPER SENSE OF URGENCY ON SUBJECT WHICH PREVAILS WITHIN GOI. IF DELAYS OR BARRIERS TO FULLY FAVORABLE RESPONSE MATERIALIZE, WE TRUST THAT EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO BE AS FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE (E.G. PARTIAL DELIVERY IN 1972) AND THAT PERSUASIVE RATIONALE CAN BE DEVELOPED TO FULLY EXPLAIN TO SHAH REASONS FOR ANY SHORTCOMING. IN ORDER TO DIMINISH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IMPACT.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, IR 
SUBJECT: TRIALS/EXECUTIONS OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS: STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE AND SHAH LASHES OUT AT FOREIGN CRITICS 
 
1. IN PROTEST AGAINST RECENT TRIALS/PUNISHMENT (PARTICULARLY EXECUTIONS, WHICH NOW TOTAL 10) OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT-ELEMENTS, TEHRAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS -- LEAD BY FACULTY OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS-- MOUNTED ON-CAMPUS DEMONSTRATION AFTERNOON OF MARCH 7 AND EVEN LARGE ONE (CIRC 600) MORNING OF MARCH 8. WHILE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION FELT CAPABLE OF HANDLING MARCH 7 DEMONSTRATION WITHOUT HELP OF OUTSIDE POLICE, THEY APPARENTLY FELT UNABLE DO SO MARCH 8 AND CALLED NATIONAL POLICE ONTO CAMPUS FOR BRIEF PERIOD. RESULT WAS MUCH MANHANDLING OF STUDENTS BUT THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF ANY SERIOUS CASUALTIES/CLASHES, AND UNIVERSITY WAS QUIET BY EARLY AFTERNOON. 
 
2. SOME FACULTIES AT OTHER TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES (E.G. ARYAMEHR, NATIONAL AND POLYTECHNIC) ARE REPORTED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN SYMPATHY STRIKES\" MARCH 8 BUT SO FAR NO DEMONSTRATIONS REPORTED* THERE IS RELIABLE REPORT THAT DEMONSTRATIONS BY STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY OF MESHED (SIX OF 10 EXECUTED CAME FROM MESHED AREA) BECAME SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT UNIVERSITY WAS CLOSED THREE DAYS AGO AND STILL REMAINS CLOSED. (COMMENT: WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF GOI ORDERS TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES CLOSED UNTIL AFTER NO RUZ HOLIDAY.) 
 
3. FROM COMMENTS OF STUDENTS AND OBSERVERS CLOSE TO ACADEMIC CIRCLES, IT SEEMS CLEAR LARGE PART OF MOTIVATION FOR DEMONSTRATION AND SYMPATHY STRIKES  IS STUDENT ANGER OVER GOI\'S CONTINUED DETENTION OF SEVERAL STUDENTS AS \"ANTI-STATE\" SUBVERSIVES AND, EVEN MORE, ANGER OVER RECENT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS OF THOSE CONVICTED OF ANTI-STATE ACTIVITIES. THERE ARE ALREADY INDICATIONS, HOWEVER, THAT GOI CONSIDERS TIMING OF DEMONSTRATIONS (PERHAPS DEMONSTRATIONS THEMSELVES) PROMOTED BY ANTI-STATE ELEMENTS TO EMBARRASS GOI DURING VISIT OF CHANCELLOR BRANDT AND HIS CONSIDERABLE PRESS RETINUE. 
 
4. IN RELATED DEVELOPMENT, WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR EARS OF STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS SHAH LASHED OUT STRONGLY IN MARCH 7 PRESS CONFERENCE (WITH GERMAN PRESSMEN) AT WHAT HE LABELLED DISTORTED FOREIGN REPORTING ABOUT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS. HIM HIT AT LE MONDE VIGOROUSLY AND REPEATEDLY, AND TOOK PARTICULAR EXCEPTION TO LE MONDE\'S APPEAL FOR CLEMENCY FOR THOSE CONVICTED IN RECENT TRIALS. AFTER ASKING TWO RHETORICAL QUESTIONS \"HAS LE MONDE EVER ASKED WHETHER THESE MURDERERS HAVE RIGHT TO TAKE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE? HAS LE MONDE EVER WRITTEN ONE WORD OF CONDEMNATION AGAINST TERRORISTS AND ASSASSINS SENT BY IRA TO EXTERMINATE PEOPLE?\"), SHAH SAID FOREIGN PRESS HAS NO RIGHT GIVE ADVICE ON MATTERS THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. HE RECALLED HIS \"CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY\" NOT TO PERMIT \"TERROR OR ATTEMPTS AGAINST MY COUNTRY\'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY BY AGENTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\"

SUMMARY: TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN IRAN SEEM TO BE INCREASING INSTEAD OF USUAL SUMMER SUBSIDENCE DUE TO VACATION FOR STUDENTS, PERHAPS INDICATING BETTER ORGANIZATION AND BROADENING OF APPEAL TO NON-STUDENT GROUPS. VIGOROUS ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN ON PART OF IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS IS NETTING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS BUT HARSH GOI POLICY APPARENTLY UNABLE BRING GUERRILLAS UNDER CONTROL AND MAY IN FACT BE HARDENING ATTITUDES OF GUERRILLAS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS. WHILE TERRORIST GROUPS NOT YET THREAT TO REGIME, GOI UNLIKELY SUCCEED IN HALTING THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT FIRST ADDRESSING BASIC QUESTION OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. DESPITE CONTINUING LARGE-SCALE CAMPAIGN ON PART OF GOI SECURITY ORGANS, URBAN GUERRILLAS ARE MAINTAINING RATE OF ACTIVITY. DURING PAST FOUR MONTH PERIOD THERE HAVE BEEN 28 CONFIRMED EXPLOSIONS (11 OF WHICH DIRECTED AGAINST US PRESENCE), TEN SHOOTOUTS AND SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS INCLUDING UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP DAUGHTER OF COURT MINISTER ALAM, AND PLOT TO SABOTAGE ISFAHAN STEEL MILL. OTHER UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS REPORTED ON ALMOST DAILY BASIS. 
 
2. IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANS, INCLUDING SAVAEEEAAA GENDARMERIE AND LOCAL POLICE, REACTING VIGOROUSLY AND WITH HEAVY HAND. DURING SAME PERIOD AT LEAST 16 GUERRILLAS KILLED IN CONFRONTATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, 13 OTHERS ANNOUNCED EXECUTED, TEN SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT REPRIEVED AND SENTENCE TO LIFE IN PRISON, NINE OTHERS GIVEN LIFE, AND 39 CONVICTED AND GIVEN SENTENCES RANGING FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS. ALL OF ABOVE TRIED BY MILITARY TRIBUNALS, AND MAJLES HAS RECENTLY PASSED LAW PROVIDING SPECIFICALLY THAT ALL THOSE ENGAGING IN ACTS OF SABOTAGE WILL BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WITH POSSIBLE SENTENCES RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO DEATH. GOI HAS COMMITTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TO SO FAR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO CONTROL TERRORISTS--FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF OFFICERS NORMALLY DETAILED TO WORK WITH BNDD AGENTS ON NARCOTICS MATTERS HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED TO GUERRILLA PROBLEM. 
 
3. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED IN TEHRAN THAT URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT A GREATER NUMBER OF INCIDENTS ARE BEING REPORTED IN THE CONTROLLED LOCAL MEDIA. BUT INCREASED RAPPORTAGE, WHICH MAY RESULT AS MUCH FROM REPUTED PRESSURE FROM LOCAL PRESSMEN ON GOI AS FROM CONTINUING GOVERNMENT DESIRE TO EXPLOIT LESS SAVORY ASPECTS OF GUERRILLA OPERATIONS DOES NOT COVER ALL INCIDENTS INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED BY EMBASSY LET ALONE THE MANY GUERRILLA ACTIVITY WHICH ARE RUMORED BUT NOT CONFIRMED. MOREOVER FREQUENCY OF UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAS INCREASED BY A FACTOR AT LEAST AS GREAT AS THAT OF THOSE GIVEN MEDIA COVERAGE, LEADING TO PRESUMPTION THAT STEPPED UP TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS A REALITY AND NOT A RESULT OF INSPIRED PUBLICITY. PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN INCREASED GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS FACT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF INCIDENTS HAS CONTINUED INTO SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS, WHO HAVE IN PAST PROVIDED BULK OF RECRUITS FOR GUERRILLAS, DISPERSED FOR VACATIONS. THIS MAY MEAN THAT UNDERGROUND MOVEMENTS ARE BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND ARE CATCHING ON WITH NON-STUDENT GROUPS, WHICH IF TRUE, WOULD HEIGHTEN DIFFICULTY OF PENETRATING AND CONTROLLING GUERRILLA GROUPS. 
 
4. DESPITE GOI APPARENT INABILITY TO SUPPRESS GUERRILLAS, EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT TERRORISTS AT PRESENT CONSTITUE AN IRRITANT AND EMRARRASSMENT BUT POSE NO THREAT TO REGIME. HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT TO US, AGAIN VERY TENTATIVELY, THAT GOI TACTICS OF HARSH REPRESSION AGAINST GUERRILLAS ARE NOT WORKING VERY WELL AND MAY PROVOKE SNOWBALL EFFECT OF ACTION AND REACTION PART OF SAVAK TERRORISTS, LEADING TO BROADENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE AGAINST SAVAK PERVASIVENESS AND TACTICS. EVENTUALLY REGIME WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS RESPONSIVE TO AT LEAST SOME OF THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMPLAINTS WHICH FORM BASES OF GUERRILLA DISSATISFACTION. WE DO NOT ENUMMERATE THESE COMPLAINTS HERE, PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY FORMED AND DEFINED IN OUR OWN MINDS OR EVEN, PERHAPS IN THE MINDS OF THE TERRORISTS THEMSELVES. MOREOVER, TERRORIST MOVEMENT IS NOT IDEOLOGICALLY OR ORGANIZATIONALLY UNIFIED AND NATURE OF THEIR COMPLAINTS VARIES FROM GROUP TO GROUP. WE SHALL BE EXAMINING FURTHER AND REPORTING ON THESE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT. MEANWHILE, WITHOUT SOUNDING ANY ALARM BELLS, THIS MESSAGE IS INTENDED TO ALERT THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE URBAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN IRAN CONTINUES TO BE A FACT OF LOCAL POLITICAL LIFE WHICH BEARS CONTINUING SCRUTINY. 
 
5. THE U.S. PRESENCE IN IRAN, WHILE TARGETED BY THE TERRORISTS, IS NOT THEIR PRIMARY TARGET AND SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE SUCH AS PRESIDENT NIXON\'S MAY VISIT (SEE REFTEL) OR THE JANUARY SAVAK TV SHOW WHICH PRECEDE LAST SPRING\'S SHOW TRIALS HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO BRING ON BOMBINGS AT AMERICAN INSTALLATIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING ALL REASONABLE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS.

E.O. 12958: AS AMENDED; DECLASSIFIED JUNE 21, 2006 
TAGS: IR, PTER 
SUBJECT: CONTINUING TERRORIST VIOLENCE 
 
REF: TEHRAN 4887 
 
SUMMARY: FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION OF GENERAL SAID TAHERI, BOMBING AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE. SAVAK MAINTAINING ITS POLICY OF WIDESPREAD PREVENTIVE ARRESTS AND, WHILE THIS RUNS RISK OF HEIGHTENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE, OFFICIALS SEEM CONFIDENT THAT GUERRILLAS ARE ON THE RUN. WE ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE OFFICIAL OPTIMISM AND FEEL THAT SANGUINE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND THE GUERRILLA REACTION THEY USUALLY PROVOKE MAY FURTHER ERODE CREDIBILITY OF SECURITY ORGANS IN MIND OF PUBLIC. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. IN WAKE OF SMOOTHLY HANDLED ASSASSINATION AUGUST 13 OF HEAD OF PRISONS BRIGADIER GENERAL SAID TAHERI (REFTEL) WHO WAS ALSO CHIEF OF AN ANTI-GUERRILLA SUBCOMMITTEE WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, FREQUENCY OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAS INCREASED. RECENT CONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAVE INCLUDED A BOMB IN A TEHRAN DEPARTMENT STORE WHICH INJURED THE TERRORIST PLANTING IT, BOMB IN TEHRAN NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY BUILDING WHICH KILLED WATCHMAN, APPREHENSION OF A TERRORIST IN SOUTH TEHRAN WHICH RESULTED IN ONE KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED, AND SHOOTING TO DEATH OF THREE POLICEMEN IN A SMALL BAZAAR IN SOUTH TEHRAN. NUMEROUS OTHER BOMBINGS AND SHOOTINGS RUMORED BUT NOT VERIFIED BY EMBASSY OR CONFIRMED BY GOI. 
 
2. SAVAK AND OTHER SECURITY ORGANS ARE PROCEEDING WITH A WIDESPREAD AND, WE HEAR, NOT VERY WELL TARGETED ROUND-UP OF SUSPECTS, AIDED BY LISTS OF NAMES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FOUND IN DWELLING OF A RECENTLY SLAIN TERRORIST LEADER. POLICE NETS, WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY HAULING IN THE INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY, HAVE EXTENDED AS FAR AFIELD AS ISFAHAN WHERE A NUMBER OF SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED TWO WEEKS AGO. 
 
3. DESPITE INCREASING LEVEL OF GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, POLICE OFFICIALS REMAIN OPTIMISTIC. CHIEF OF NATIONAL POLICE LTG JAFFARQOLI SADRI ASSURED EMBOFF AUG. 17 THAT CURRENT FLURRY OF INCIDENTS CONSTITUTES DYING GASP OF GUERRILLAS WHO, HE CLAIMS, HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY TWO THIRDS IN PAST YEAR AND ARE FORCED TO ACT NOW TO SHOW THEY STILL EXIST. IN A MEDIA INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN LOCAL PRESS AUG. 19, SADRI UPPED FIGURE FOR REDUCTION OF GUERRILLA FORCES TO THREE FOURTHS, PREDICTED THAT REMAINING TERRORISTS WOULD SOON BE WIPED OUT AND REITERATED STANDARD GOVERNMENT LINE THAT GUERRILLAS ARE CONFUSED MISGUIDED INDIVIDUALS OF MARXIST-LENINIST BENT BUT WITHOUT GOALS OR PROGRAM. IN DISCUSSION WITH EMBOFF SADRI ATTACHED NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO MURDER OF GENERAL TAHERI, ASSERTING THAT TERRORISTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISIFED WITH ANY HIGH-RANKING OFFICER AND CHOSE TAWERI ONLY BECUASE OF IOSLATED LOCATION OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR LONG WALKS ALONE. SADRI ALSO DISCOUNTED POSSIBILITY THAT ASSASSINS WERE OF HIGHER CALIBER THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL GUERRILLAS, POINTING OUT THAT SHOTS WHICH KILLED TAHERI HAD BEEN FIRED FROM 50 CENTIMETERS AND THAT \"A CHILD COULD HIT A MAN FROM THAT DISTANCE.\" 
 
COMMENT: WE CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAT TAHERI WAS PERSONALLY TARGETED DUE TO HIS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, SKILLFUL MANNER IN WHICH ASSASSINATION CARRIED OUT, REQUIRING CAREFUL PLANNING AND RECONNAISSANCE AS WELL AS DEFT EXECUTION, APPEARS TO INDICATE THAT THOSE INVOLVED WERE MUCH BETTER TRAINED THAN AVERAGE TERRORISTS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP BY THEIR OWN BOMBS. 
 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NUMBER OF GUERRILLA INCIDENTS WILL BEGIN TO TAPER OFF, BUT WE DO NOT SHARE SADRI\'S CONFIDENCE THAT HIS TACTICS AND THOSE OF SAVAK CAN COMPLETELY HALT TERRORIST ACTIVITY. IN FACT OVER REACTION AND TOO ZEALOUS A REPRESSION BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS SEEM AT LEAST AS LIKELY TO RECRUIT NEW GUERRILLAS AS TO STAMP OUT OLD ONES. IN ADDITION WISDOM SEEMS QUESTIONABLE OF SECURITY OFFICIALS MAKING PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT BREAKUP OF GUERRILLA GROUPS AND PREDICTIONS OF THEIR DEMISE. WE RECALL THAT THE LAST SUCH ANNOUNCEMENT LAST JANUARY WAS FOLLOWED BY SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS ON US-PROPERTIES AND OTHER SITES IN TEHRAN. IN OUR VIEW SUCH PUBLIC DECLARATIONS RUN RISK OF INCREASING CREDIBILITY GAP AND RESENTMENT ON PART OF PUBLIC WHO LIKELY BE INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE OF INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE STAMPING OUT TERRORISTS. 
 
THE PROGNOSTICATION THEREFORE IS FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE TERRORISM BUT, DESPITE SUCCESSFUL MURDER OF TAHERI, WE DO NOT CONCLUDE THAT GUERRILLAS WILL NOW PLACE GREATER RELIANCE ON ASSASSINATION AS A TOOL. REASON IS THAT TERRORISTS STILL LACK ENOUGH TRAINED PERSONNEL TO PULL OFF ASSASSINATIONS ON REGULAR BASIS.

SUMMARY: AFTER APRIL 5 PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS 
EXPECT HAVE PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH SHAH. I PLAN 
LISTEN BUT IF SUBJECT OF PAKISTAN AND SHAH\' S CONCERNS 
REGARDING US/ USSR NEGOTIATIONS COME UP THIS 
WILL BE GOOD OCCASION TO PASS ON ANY THOUGHTS WE 
HAVE REGARDING PAKISTAN AS BHUTTO ARRIVING TEHRAN 
APRIL 7 AND TO REASSURE SHAH TOTAL ERA OF NEGOTIATION 
WITH MOSCOW DOES NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLY LESSENING OF 
TIES WITH IRAN. END SUMMARY. ACTION REQUESTED: 
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE BY OPEN OF BUSINESS APRIL 4 
SUMMARY OF OUR ECONOMIC AID TO PAKISTAN IN LAST 18 
MONTHS, HIGHLIGHTS OF RECENTLY REVISED ANNOUNCED ARMS 
POLICY TO PAKISTAN AND ANY OTHER POINTS DEPT OR ISLAMABAD 
THINK USEFUL TO PASS TO SHAH REGARDING BHUTTO VISIT. 
 
1. ON MORNING APRIL 5 I WILL BE PRESENTING MY CREDENTIALS 
TO SHAH. THIS OCCASION TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER 
AUDIENCES BEING SCHEDULED FOR APRIL DURING VISITS OF 
DEPSEC RUSH AND GENERALS GOODPASTER AND RYAN WILL 
PROVIDE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO SHAH MESSAGES OR 
THOUGHTS WE MAY HAVE ON: ( A) US/ IRANIAN RELATIONS, 
( B) DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND, ( C) ROLE 
IRAN CAN PLAY IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. 
 
2. AT PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS CEREMONY SHAH\' S CUSTOM 
IS TO TAKE AMBASSADOR ASIDE AFTER CEREMONIALS FOR PRIVATE 
CONVERSATION. THIS BEING MY FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING 
WITH SHAH AS AMBASSADOR, MY INTENTION IS TO LISTEN TO 
WHAT SHAH HAS TO SAY. I ANTICIPATE SHAH, AS IS HIS CUSTOM, 
WILL TAKE ME ON ONE OF HIS \" TOUR D\' HORIZONS\". WITH 
BHUTTO EXPECTED IN TOWN APRIL 7, PAKISTAN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY 
COME UP. SHAH WILL PROBABLY CHIDE US FOR NOT HELPING 
BHUTTO ADEQUATELY. IF SO, I PLAN REMIND SHAH OF ALL WE 
HAVE DONE ECONOMICALLY FOR PAKISTAN IN LAST YEAR OR SO 
AND OF RECENT DECISION TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO ON NILITARY 
ITEMS FROZEN IN PIPELINE SINCE 1971. TO THIS END WOULD 
APPRECIATE HAVING BY MORNING APRIL 4 LOCAL TIME BREAKDOWN 
OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN FOR LAST 18 MONTHS AND 
MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENT ARMS POLICY TOWARDS PAKISTAN 
AND INDIA. 
 
3. IN ADDITION GIVEN SHAH\' S CLOSE RELATIONS WITH 
BHUTTO AND INFLUENCE ON PAK PRESIDENT, ARE TTHERE ANY 
POINTS REGARDING PAKISTAN WHICH DEPT OR ISLAMABAD THINK 
I COULD USEFULLY PUT TO SHAH FOR HIS TALKS WITH BHUTTO. 
 
4. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED ZAHEDI\' S DESCRIPTION OF SHAH\' S 
CONCERNS, WE BELIEVE THIS TO REFLECT SHAH\' S WORRY OVER 
TREND OF EVENTS IN THIS AREA WHICH HE CONSIDERS HOSTILE 
TO IRANIAN INTERESTS AND HIS NEED FOR PERIODIC REASSURANCE 
THAT HE IS NOT ISOLATED, THAT HE CAN COUNT ON 
CONTINUED US INTEREST IN IRAN AND THAT ANY DETENTE 
ACHIEVED BETWEEN US AND USSR WILL NOT WORK TO IRAN\' S 
DISADVANTAGE. 
 
5. IF SUBJECT COMES UP I PROPOSE MAKE SAME POINTS AS 
DEPSEC RUSH MADE TO ZAHEDI AND ASSURE HIM THAT WE 
HAVE NOT AND WOULD NOT DISCUSS IRAN/ US RELATIONS WITH 
USSR WITHOUT IRAN\' S FULL KNOWLEDGE. 
 
6. FINALLY, AT APPROPRIATE TIME I SHALL MENTION 
PRESIDENT\' S DEEP INTEREST IN HAVING SHAH AND EMPRESS 
PAY OFFICIAL VISIT TO WASHINGTON DURING 1973.

OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT, GROUP, WHICH INCLUDED FILMMAKERS, CAMERAMEN

SUBJECT: SHAH ON CORRUPTION 
 
1. AFTER AMBASSADOR BYROADE\'S AUDIENCE WITH SHAH WAS 
FINISHED, I ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO DISCUSS WITH SHAH 
APPROACH OF SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO SWEDISH AMBASSADOR AND 
OTHERS ABOUT ALLEGED INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OPPOSITION TO 
GOI AS RESULT SHAH\'S RECENT DECREES ON CORRUPTION AND ON 
NEW REQUIREMENT THAT GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND IMMEDIATE 
SUBORDINATES DIVEST THEMSELVES OF ANY SHARES THEY HOLD IN 
ANY COMPANIES OR INDUSTRIES. SHAH WAS OBVIOUSLY STARTLED 
TO LEARN THAT SOVIETS WERE CLAIMING TO NOTE INCREASED 
OPPOSITION AND ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW ANYONE COULD IMAGINE 
SUCH A THING. WE AGREED THAT THIS WAS SOVIET PSYCHOLOGICAL 
WARFARE DESIGNED TO UNSETTLE THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
THE SHAH IMMEDIATELY TIED IT IN TO THE RECENT 
TUDEH PARTY/IRAQI COMMUNIST PROCLAMATION CRITICIZING GOI 
ACTIVITIES. SHAH IS CONVINCED THAT SOVIETS ARE ATTEMPTING 
TO RECREATE TUDEH PARTY AND PUT MONEY INTO STRENGTHENING 
OF IRANIAN COMMUNIST MOVEMENT. 
 
2. BEING PENSIVE FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT WE HAD BEEN 
DISCUSSING, THE SHAH SAID, \"PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN TOO TOUGH 
ON CORRUPTION.\" TO WHICH I IMMEDIATELY REPLIED, \"NO, SIR, 
YOU CANNOT BE TOO TOUGH ON CORRUPTION.\" THERE THEN ENSUED 
A DISCUSSION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN IRAN IN THE YEARS AHEAD 
IF CORRUPTION IS NOT STEMMED WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
FLOATING AROUND IN THE ECONOMY. IT WAS QUITE CLEAR FROM 
THIS DISCUSSION THAT THE SHAH INDEED IS CONVINCED THAT HIS 
PROGRAM AND THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE WILL GO RIGHT DOWNHILL 
IF HE IS NOT ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION ISSUE. 
 
3. WHEN THE SHAH MENTIONED HIS INSISTENCE THAT CERTAIN 
HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DIVEST THEMSELVES OF STOCKS 
AND HOLDINGS, I SAID, \"WON\'T MANY OF THEM HAVE TO UNLOAD?\" 
THE SHAH REPLIED, \"A FEW, NOT ALL.\"

TAGS: PINT, IR 
SUBJECT: IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY CREATED BY SHAH 
 
SUMMARY: CREATION OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY ANNOUNCED BY SHAH 
MARCH 2 IS MOVE TO SEEK BROADER SUPPORT FOR MONARCHY AND THE SHAHPEOPLE 
REVOLUTION. ALL IRANIANS OF VOTING AGE ARE EXPECTED TO 
EXPRESS ALLEGIANCE TO NEW PARTY OR RISK BEING VIEWED AS OPPONENTS 
OF SHAH AND EVEN TRAITORS WHO SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON. 
SHAH EXPLAINED IRAN\'S RETURN TO SINGLE PARTY SYSTEM AS NECESSARY 
BECAUSE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES UNQTE BY SOME IRANIANS SHOWED NEED 
FOR IRANIANS TO CLOSE RANKS IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE QTE GREAT 
CIVILIZATION, UNQTE AND BECAUSE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD FAILED. 
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR SUMMER WILL APPARENTLY BE HELD, BUT IT IS 
NOT CLEAR HOW THEY WILL BE ORGANIZED. NET RESULT IS TO MAKE 
IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM LESS FLEXIBLE. INTERNATIONAL REACTION 
WILL PROBABLY RANGE FROM INDIFFERENCE TO CHARGES OF INCREASED 
TOTALITARIANISM. SHAH APPARENTLY PLANS TO CONTINUE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT 
IN DAILY POLITICAL AFFAIRS. THIS IS CONTRARY TO EARLIER SUGGESTIONS 
THAT HE MIGHT BE MOVING GRADUALLY TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO 
BROAD POLICY GUIDANCE AND LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION TO GOVERNMENT. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
1. SHAH\'S LENGTHY STATEMENT AT HIS MARCH 2 PRESS CONFERENCE, FROM 
WITH CORRESPONDENTS FOR FOREIGN MEDIA WERE EXCLUDED, (TEXT SENT BY 
AIRGRAM) ESTABLISHED IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. NEW PARTY WILL 
ABSORB RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY, LOYAL OPPOSITION MARDOM PARTY, 
AND THE ULTRA-NATIONALIST PAN IRANIST PARTY AND ITS SPLINTER 
GROUP THE IRANIANS PARTY. PRIME MINISTER HOVEYDA IS TO BE SECRETARY 
GENERAL FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS. SHAH WILL LATER 
PROPOSE CHAIRMAN OF NEW PARTY\'S EXECUTIVE BOARD AND PRESIDENT FOR 
ITS POLITICAL BUREAU. A PARTY CONGRESS WILL BE HELD, PERHAPS 
WITHIN TWO MONTHS. GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD THIS SUMMER 
UNDER AUSPICES OF NEW PARTY. 
 
2. SHAH\'S STATEMENT BEGAN WITH FAMILIAR RECITATION OF IRAN\'S 
GROWING SELF-RELIANCE AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE CONTRASTING SHARPLY 
WITH ITS RELATIVE WEAKNESS IN FIRST HALF OF CENTURY. HE NOTED THAT 
OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE CREATED IN RESPONSE TO HIS OWN WISHES 
AND COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN FACED WITH A DIFFICULT TASK. 
SHAH OBSERVED THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO FULFILL THEIR PROPER ROLE. HE 
COMMENTED THAT SOME IRANIANS HAD MADE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES 
UNQTE WHICH REFLECTED A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN\' GOALS. IN 
ORDER TO WELD ALL IRANIANS TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF GOALS OF THE 
SHAH-PEOPLE REVOLUTION, HE HAD, THEREFORE, DECIDED TO CREATE NEW 
ORGANIZATION WHICH WOULD SUPPRESS PARTY DIFFERENCES. ONLY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR MEMBERSHIP IN NEW ORGANIZATION WOULD BE LOYALTY TO (1) 
MONARCHY, (2) IRAN\'S CONSTITUTION, AND (3) SIXTH OF BAHMAN (SHAHPEOPLE) 
REVOLUTION. HE SPECIFICALLY SAID NEW PARTY WOULD FOSTER 
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, AND HE PREDICTED THAT POLITICAL WINGS 
WOULD EVOLVE WITHIN NEW PARTY. HE URGED ALL IRANIANS ELIGIBLE TO 
VOTE TO ENTER INTO NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURE OR CLARIFY THEIR POSITION. 
BY THIS HE MEANT THAT THOSE WHO COULD NOT AGREE WITH THE 
THREE PRINCIPLES SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON AS TRAITORS 
UNLESS THEY OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL AND WERE NOT ANTINATIONAL. 
IF DISAPPROVAL IS IDEOLOGICAL, PERSON WOULD REMAIN FREE 
IN IRAN BUT QTE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS UNQTE. FULL 
PARTICIPATION IN IRAN\'S PROGRESS WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE MEMBERSHIP 
IN THE IRAN RESURGENCE PARTY. HE SAID IT WAS HIS EXPECTATION 
THAT WORKERS, FARMERS, AND TEACHERS WOULD BE THE FIRST GROUPS TO 
ANNOUNCE THEIR LOYALTY TO THE NEW PARTY. 
 
3. COMMENT: ABOVE ALL, SHAH\'S ACTION IN RETURNING TO SINGLE PARTY 
SYSTEM OF 1964-67 PERIOD SHOWS HIS EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM 
AND STRONG DESIRE TO RECEIVE OVERT EVIDENCE OF POPULAR SUPPORT. 
AFTER HE EXPERIMENTED WITH TAME OPPOSITION PARTIES IN 
1956-64 PERIOD WITH POOR RESULTS, SHAH THEN TURNED TO HASSAN ALI 
MANSUR\'S PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY TO CREATE IRAN NOVIN PARTY AS INSTRUMENT 
TO IMPLEMENT HIS SIXTH OF BAHMAN REVOLUTION. MARDOM PARTY 
WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REJUVENATED TO STIMULATE IRAN NOVIN TO PERFORM 
MORE EFFECTIVELY. DESPITE CONSTANT STATEMENTS OF LOYALTY TO SHAH 
AND HIS PLANS FOR IRAN, PARTIES HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PLEASED HIM. 
AS INDICATED BY FAILURES OF FORMER MARDOM PARTY SECRETARIES 
GENERAL ALI NAQI AND NASSER AMERI, EVEN ACTIVITIES OF GELDED 
OPPOSITION HAD PROVED TOO CRITICAL FOR SHAH\'S TASTE. NEVERTHELESS 
HIS PAST STATEMENTS INDICATED CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR COCCEPT OF 
MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM IN IRAN, AND IMPERIAL DECISION TO INSTITUTE ONEPARTY 
STATE REPRESENTS 180-DEGREE SHIFT IN POLICY WHICH ALSO 
APPEARS TO NEGATE EARLIER PROMISES OF FREER ELECTIONS LATER THIS 
YEAR. KEY SECTION OF SPEECH IS COMMENT THAT HE HAD HEARD QTE SOME 
REALLY SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES, WHICH IN NOW WAY SHOULD BE EXPECTED 
FROM AN IRANIAN. THIS SCENE, OF COURSE, HAS ALWAYS RECURRED WHEN 
IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE DEFENCE OF ITS RIGHTS AT A HISTORIC 
JUNCTURE. THIS SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE, UNQTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WE DOUBT THAT MUCH CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WILL EMERGE 
FROM THE IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. 
 
4. IN OPERATIONAL TERMS LITTLE HAS CHANGED, FOR DESPITE FACADE OF 
QTE ME-TOO UNQTE OPPOSITION PARTIES SHAH HAS ALWAYS CALLED THE 
TUNE AND ONLY RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY HAD ANY IMPORTANCE. PRIME 
MINISTER HAS BEEN LEAD DANCER, AND HIS SELECTION AS SECGEN AT 
JANUARY PARTY CONGRESS HAD TIED IRAN NOVIN PARTY EVEN CLOSER TO 
SHAH. IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF NEW MOVE HAS BEEN FLOOD OF STATEMENTS 
OF LOYALTY TO SHAH, CONSTITUTION AND REVOLUTION, BOTH BY 
GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS CLEARLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR 
IRANIANS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN IRAN\'S DEVELOPMENT 
AND SHARE ITS PROSPERITY. ALL DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT 
SHAH\'S PLAN FOR IRAN WILL BE SUPPRESSED UNTIL NEW PARTY 
DEVELOPS AN IDEOLOGY AND ITS LEADERSHIP IS CONSTITUTED. 
 
5. SHAH\'S SPEECH IS VAGUE ON GOALS OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY AND 
MANY OTHER POINTS. IT IS NOT CLEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CANDIDATES 
WILL BE SELECTED FOR SUMMER ELECTIONS AND ON WHAT PLATFORMS THEY 
WILL RUN. SPEECH SHOWS SIGNS OF HURRIED PREPARATION FOR ISSUANCE 
PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR ALGIERS. WHILE MOST IRANIANS WILL 
ACCEPT NEW CHANGE WITH TYPICAL CYNICISM, IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ALL 
PARTIES FOR FAILING TO GET BEHIND SHAH\'S PUSH FOR REVOLUTION FROM 
THE TOP MAY ALIENATE SOME PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE 
WORKED HARD FOR IRAN NOVIN PARTY ON ASSUMPTION THEY WERE CARRYING 
OUT SHAH\'S WISHES. 
 
6. INTERNATIONAL REACTION WILL PROBABLY VARY FROM INDIFFERENCE TO 
INCREASINGLY SHRILL CHARGES OF TOTALITARIANISM. IRAN\'S IMAGE AS 
COUNTRY IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS WERE BEING TAPPED IN DEVELOPMENT 
PROCESS MAY SUFFER UNLESS NEW PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP COMES FROM BROAD 
SPECTRUM. IT APPEARS THAT EARLIER SUCCESSFUL IRANIAN POLICY OF 
COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY QTE TAKE IT OR 
LEAVE IT UNQTE STANCE IN DEALING WITH OPPOSITION. 
 
7. IN A-19 EMBASSY NOTED THAT SHAH HOPES TO MOVE TOWARD SITUATION 
IN WHICH HE GIVES POLICY GUIDANCE BUT KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM 
DAILY ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT. INITAL IMPRESSION OF HIS ACTION IN 
CREATING NEW POLITICAL PARTY AND FORECASTING HIS PERSONAL SELECTION 
OF SOME OF ITS LEADERS IS THAT HE HAS RETURNED TO MORE DIRECT 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. BETTER JUDGMENT ON THIS 
POINT CAN BE MADE WHEN FUNCTION OF NEW PARTY BECOME CLEAR. 
 
8. IN SUM, GIVEN EXISTING STRICT DEGREE OF POLITICAL CONTROLS, 
SHAH\'S DECISION TO MELD ALL POLITICAL PARTIES INTO ONE APPEARS TO 
OFFER LITTLE IN WAY OF IMPROVEMENTS TO IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM 
WHILE ADDING SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

SUBJ: SERIOUS RELIGIOUS DISSIDENCE IN QOM 
 
1. IN MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT OF THIS SORT FOR YEARS, 5 
DEMONSTRATORS WERE SHOT DEAD AND 9 INJURED WHEN POLICE 
OPENED FIRE ON A CROWD ATTEMPTING TO OCCUPY A POLICE 
STATION IN THE HIGHLY RELIGIOUS CITY OF QOM JAN 9. A 
POLICE OFFICE AND 3 POLICEMEN WERE INJURED BY THE 
DEMONSTRATORS AND ONE 13 YEAR BOY WAS TRAMPLED TO DEATH 
IN THE STAMPEDE THAT FOLLOWED THE SHOOTING. 
 
2. INCIDENT OCCURRED ON ANNIVERSARY OF LAND REFORM 
LEGISLATION PASSED IN 1963. IT FOLLOWED A MUCH MILDER 
PROTEST BY STUDENTS OF RELIGION SHOUTING ANTI-NATIONAL 
SLOGANS ON JAN 7 THE 42ND ANNIVERSARY OF REZA SHAH\'S 
DECREE ABOLISHING THE VEIL FOR WOMEN. 
 
3. ON THE 9TH A MOB OF PROTESTORS ARMED WITH STONES, 
IRON BARS, AND WOODEN STAVES REPORTEDLY RAMPAGED THROUGH 
THE STREETS SMASHING WINDOWS OF SHOPS AND DESTROYING 
PREMISES OF REASTAKHIZ PARTY HEADQUARTERS. THEY THEN 
TRIED TO TAKE OVER A POLICE STATION, DAMAGING POLICE 
VEHICLES OUTSIDE. POLICE WARNINGS AND WARNING SHOTS INTO 
THE AIR WENT UNHEEDED, AND POLICE THEN FIRED INTO THE 
CROWD. 
 
4. INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS 
BY PARS NEW AGENCY AFTERNOON JAN 10. SAME INFORMATION WAS 
GIVEN TO DCM BY COURT MINISTER HOVEYDA AT SHAH\'S DINNER 
THAT EVENING FOR VISITING CODE. 
 
5. COMMENT: DEMONSTRATIONS ARE BEING ASCRIBED BY POLICE 
AUTHORITIES -- ACCURATELY WE BELIEVE -- TO CONSERVATIVE 
RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION ELEMENTS (THOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY TO 
FOLLOWERS OF KHOMEINI OR TO ISLAMIC MARXISTS AS SUCH). 
THIS IS FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS, IN OUR RECOLLECTION, 
THAT POLICE HAVE KILLED SEVERAL DEMONSTRATORS BY FIRING 
INTO A CROWD. SEVERITY OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD APPEAR TO 
ARGUE AGAINST THOSE AMONG THE JOURNALISTS AND OTHER 
OBSERVERS HERE WHO HAVE SUSPECTED MANY RECENT INCIDENTS 
WERE COOKED UP BY IRANIAN SECURITY FORCES TO IMPRESS THE 
SHAH AND/OR USG. BY THE SAME TOKEN, IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
CONCLUDE THAT RELATIVE POLICE LENIENCY, AS FOR EXAMPLE IN 
LACK OF EFFECTIVE REACTION TO STUDENT DEMONSTRATION JAN 7, 
ENCOURAGED MORE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WHICH NECESSITATED 
VIOLENT REPRESSION TO PUT DOWN. AT LEAST IT IS CONCEIVABLE 
THAT THE MANY PROPONENTS OF THE MAILED FIST IN GOI 
ESTABLISHMENT MIGHT SO ARGUE TO THE SHAH AND PRIMIN 
AMOUZEGAR IN EFFORT TO REVERSE RELATIVE LIBERALIZATION OF 
RECENT MONTHS.

E.O. 11652: GDS 
TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINT, AF, US 
SUBJECT: FIRST CONVERSATION WITH NEW AFGHAN PRESIDENT 
 
1. MUR MOHAMHAD TARAKI, THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN\'S NEW 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND HE LIKES TO BE CALLED \"MR. PRESIDENT,\" 
RECEIVED ME ALONE IN HIS OFFICE AT THE OLD PRIME MINISTRY BUILDING 
AT 5 P.M. ON MAY 6, I WAS RECEIVED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING 
BY THE SAME CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF PROTOCOL WHO HAD SERVED THE 
PREVIOUS REGIME. AS AN INDICATION OF THE TIMES, THE DEPUTY CHIEF, 
WHO IS A MOHAMMADZAI, STARTED WEEPING WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS 
FAMILY. IT WAS IN THIS MOOD THAT HE USHERED ME INTO HIS NEW CHIEF\'S 
OFFICE. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS SEEMED TO BE MINIMAL, WITH ONLY ONE 
ARMORED VEHICLE VISIBLE IN THE COMPOUND OF THE PRIME MINISTRY. 
 
2. TABAKI GREETED ME WITH A WARM HANDSHAKE AND A FRIENDLY SMILE, 
DULY RECORDED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS. WE THEN SAT DOWN IN THE CORNER OF 
HIS OFFICE AND EXCHANGED A FEW PLEASANTRIES WHILE OUR PICTURES 
CONTINUED TO BE SNAPPED. I GOT A GOOD LAUGH FROM HIM WHEN I SAID I 
WAS SORRY I HAD NOT MET HIM DURING MY FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS IN 
AFGHANISTAN -- AND EVEN SORRIER DURING THE PAST NINE DAYS. TARAKI 
SPOKE EXCELLENT, IF SOMEWHAT RUSTY, ENGLISH. 
 
3. TARAKI BEGAN HIS CONVERSATION BY RECOUNTING WITH OBVIOUS PRIDE 
AND RELISH THE SUCCESS OF HIS REVOLUTION, STRESSING THAT IT IS A 
REVOLUTION AND NOT A COUP. HE SAID ON THURSDAY, APRIL 27, THE TANKS 
FIRST MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF KABUL ABOUT 9 A.M., BUT TOOK MORE 
THAN TWO HOURS TO REACH THE CENTER OF THE CITY. BY EVENING, THE 
DAOUD REGIME HAD LOST THE BATTLE, ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED IN VAIN 
DURING THE NIGHT TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS FROM CENTRAL CORPS 
HEADQUARTERS AND FROM KARGHA. WITH THE COMING OF DAYLIGHT, HE SAID, 
THE AIR FORCE WAS ABLE TO FINISH THE JOB. MEANWHILE, WITHIN THE 
PALACE DAOUD HAD BEEN ASKED TO SURRENDER, BUT REFUSED, SHOT AT HIS 
ATTACKERS, AS DID HIS WIFE AND FAMILY, AND WAS THEREFORE KILLED. 
THE INTENTION, SAID TARAKI, HAD BEEN TO TAKE HIM AS A CAPTIVE. 
TARAKI ADDED THAT DAOUD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN COURT-MARTIALED 
AND POSSIBLY SHOT. TARAKI HAD YESTERDAY  
THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN SHOT BY DAOUD\'S \"WHITE PISTOL\". 
 
4. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WAS SURPRISED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE FIRST 
AMBASSADOR TO CALL ON HIM, BECAUSE WHAT HE IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH 
IN AFGHANISTAN IS A \"GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR 
THE PEOPLE.\" CORRECTING HIMSELF A BIT, HE SAID HE HAD ASKED THE SAME 
QUESTION OF THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR BECAUSE PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN 
HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON, CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY. 
 
5. I THEN EXPLAINED THAT IN CASES LIKE THIS, WE DO NOT EXTEND FORMAL 
RECOGNITION BUT INDICATE, AS WE HAVE DONE, THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE 
NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. I SAID, IN FACT, WE HOPE TO HAVE CLOSE 
WORKING RELATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT. I ADDED, AS OUR NOTE 
STATED, THAT I HOPE HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE SOON TO 
AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF EXISTING TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS. HE MAD NO 
COMMENT ON THAT SUGGESTION. 
 
6. AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THESE PRELIMINARY EXCHANGES, TARAKI 
REFERRED TO THE TIME HE HAD SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES, HIS 
FRIENDSHIP FOR AMERICANS, AND HIS LIKING FOR THE AMERICAN QUALITY OF 
FRANKNESS. WE AGREED THAT AFGHANS AND AMERICANS HAVE LOTS IN COMMON 
IN THIS REGARD. 
 
7. I THEN STATED I WANTED TO BE FRANK WITH HIM. I SAID THAT, AS HE 
KNEW, THE UNITED STATES HAD NEVER SOUGHT ANY STRATEGIC OR POLITICAL 
ADVANTAGE FROM AFGHANISTAN. HE AGREED. I SAID THAT ONE OF THE CARDINAL 
POINTS OF OUR POLICY IS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE, 
ITS INTEGRITY, AND ITS NATIONAL IDENTITY. HE NODDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. 
I SAID THAT SINCE THE BRITISH LEFT INDIA, IT WAS OUR VIEW THAT THE 
ONLY COUNTRY THAT COULD POSSIBLY THREATEN AFGHANISTAN\'S INDEPENDENCE 
IS THE SOVIET UNION. IN PAST TIMES, I NOTED, OUR POLICY HAD BEEN TO 
TRY TO CONSTRUCT BLOCS AGAINST SOVIET EXPANSIONISM, BUT THAT OUR 
APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM HAD, IN THE COURSE OF TIME BECOME MORE 
SOPHISTICATED. 
 
I STATED WE COULD READILY UNDERSTAND -- GIVEN AFGHANISTAN\'S 
GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND ECONOMIC NEEDS -- WHY IT WOULD WANT A CLOSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION. BUT, I SAID, WE WOULD BE DISTURBED 
IF AFGHANISTAN\'S FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICIES WERE TO BECOME 
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE THAT WOULD 
OBLITERATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NATIONAL IDENTITY AND WOULD GIVE RISE TO 
TENSIONS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WHICH COULD THREATEN PEACE. I SAID 
THAT IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE APPRECIATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NONALIGNED 
POLICY. 
 
8. IN RESPONSE, TARAKI AFFIRMED THAT AFGHANISTAN IS AND DESIRES TO 
REMAIN AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY AND MASTER OF ITS OWN DESTINY. HE SAID HE 
WAS PLEASED THAT THE UNITED STATES TAKES A MORE FLEXIBLE VIEW OF THE 
WORLD AND ADMITS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT MADE A MISTAKE IN VIETNAM. HE 
REFERRED TO HIS BEING IN WASHINGTON DURING THE DAYS OF SENATOR MCCARTHY, 
AND NOTED THAT THE THEN VICE PRESIDENT NIXON HAD REFUSED ONCE TO COME 
TO AN AFGHAN EMBASSY RECEPTION BECAUSE AFGHANISTAN WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE 
SOVIET UNION. HE WAS PLEASED THAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE APPROACH THE 
UNITED STATES TAKES TOWARD HIS COUNTRY. 
 
9. I THEN SAID THAT IN EVALUATING THE POLICIES OF A GOVERNMENT IN A 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN, THE UNITED STATES WOULD LOOK FIRST 
AND FOREMOST AT WHAT THAT GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF 
LIVING OF ITS PEOPLE AND TO ASSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS -- 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND LEGAL. AT THIS POINT, TARAKI BECAME 
MUCH MORE ANIMATED AND HELD FORTH AT SOME LENGTH ON THE SUBJECT OF HOW 
HIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HE 
AND HIS COLLEAGUES -- UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, REALLY CARE ABOUT THE 
POOR PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN PUTTING MONEY IN 
SWISS BANKS. HE SAID THAT IN JUDGING HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES, WE 
SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN WHETHER THEY THINK THEY ARE 
SUCCESSFUL. IN THE PAST, HE BELIEVED FOREIGNERS TENDED TO ASK THE 
ARISTOCRATS WHO, OF COURSE, WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE POOR 
BECAUSE SUCH A POLICY WOULD THREATEN THEIR OWN PROSPERITY. REGARDING 
HUMAN RIGHTS, TARAKI SAID THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM AND THAT 
EACH NATION MUST JUDGE FOR ITSELF THE KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE MOST 
SUITED TO ITS OWN SITUATION AND CULTURE. HE MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT 
HE WOULD NOT WANT US TO MAKE VALUE JUDGEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT 
TO INTERFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. I ASSURED HIM THAT 
THE UNITED STATES HAD NO DESIRE TO TRY TO TRANSPLANT ITS GOVERNMENTAL 
SYSTEM ELSEWHERE, BUT THAT WE, NEVERTHELESS, CARE DEEPLY ABOUT HUMAN 
RIGHTS. 
 
10. TARAKI THEN SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD JUDGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS BY 
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT\'S 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMULATED, BUT THAT HE 
WOULD BE ASKING US FOR ASSISTANCE AS, INDEED, HE WOULD BE ASKING THE 
SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES. HE SAID THAT THE PRINCIPAL SLOGAN, 
ADDING THAT HE REALLY MEANT POLICY AND NOT SLOGAN, OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS 
TO PROVIDE BREAD, CLOTHING, AND SHELTER FOR THE MASSES. I DESCRIBED OUR 
AID PROGRAM OF RECENT YEARS AND ITS EMPHASIS ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND 
AGRICULTURE FOR THE RURAL POOR. HE SAID HE WOULD TELL ME, AS HE HAD 
TOLD THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR, THAT OUR RESPECTIVE AID PFORAMS HAD FAILED, 
AND THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMITMENT OF THE PREVIOUS 
REGIME. I SAID I AGREED WITH HIM THAT OUR AID PROGRAM HAD NOT ACHIEVED 
ITS GOALS. HE ASKED ME WHY. I REPLIED THAT HE KNEW HIS OWN COUNTRY 
BETTER THAN I, AND THAT I WOULD MERELY SAY THAT THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT 
WAS NOT CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WE WISHED TO 
SEE IMPLEMENTED. HE OBVIOUSLY TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN MY SAYING THIS. 
 
11. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE 
MEANT BY \"BREAD\". HE SAID HE WANTS TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF 
AFGHANS WHO HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY TO WORK IN IGNOMINY ABROAD. THIS WILL 
MEAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND HE HOPED WE 
WOULD HELP WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM THAT ONCE THE APPROPRIATE MINISTERS IN 
HIS GOVERNMENT WERE PREPARED TO DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS WITH US, MY AID 
MISSION DIRECTOR AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO. 
 
12. I THEN SAID THAT ONE OTHER MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED 
STATES IS THE STABILITY OF THIS REGION IN THE WORLD. I SAID WE HAVE BEEN 
DELIGHTED AT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN 
DEVELOPING REGIONAL COOPERATION. TARAKI SAID THAT THAT WAS, OF COURSE, 
A MATTER THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE STUDYING. HE ALSO SAID THAT WHEN 
ONE TALKS OF REGIONAL COOPERATION, THAT MEANS NOT ONLY COOPERATION WITH 
INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND IRAN -- BUT ALSO WITH THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
13. THE CONVERSATION ENDED WITH PLEASANTRIES AS IT HAD BEGUN. HE SAID 
THAT HE HOPED THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE BUILT MORE 
MOSQUES. BY THE SAME TOKEN, HE HOPED WE WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE, 
HIMSELF, DID NOT GO TO A MOSQUE. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT EVERYTHING 
HE HAD TOLD ME HE HAD ALSO TOLD THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
14. COMMENT:  TARAKI IS A SLIM, WHITE-HAIRED, PROFESSIONAL MAN WHO LOOKS 
SOMEWHAT OLDER THAN 61. HE HAS THE CHAN AND EMPATHY THAT ONE LEARNS TO 
ASSOCIATE WITH AFGHANS. HE IS ALSO CLEARLY HARDHEADED AND EXHILARATED BY 
HIS SUCCESS. WHEN HE IS PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A POINT HE IS 
MAKING, HIS EYES ASSUME A FIERCE, INTENSITY. OUR CONVERSATION WAS 
EXTREMELY CORDIAL AND WAS ALSO, I THINK, A REAL DIALOGUE.

TAGS: PEPR, IR 
SUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. INTRODUCTION: RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH THE 
EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVOLVED HERE, RANGING FROM COMPOUND 
SECURITY TO VISA OPERATIONS TO GTE TO THE SHERRY CASE, 
HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONDUCTING 
BUSINESS IN THE PERSIAN ENVIRONMENT. IN SOME INSTANCES 
THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE A PARTIAL 
REFLECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION, 
BUT WE BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
QUALITIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES 
ARE AND WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT. THEREFORE, 
WE SUGGEST THAT THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS BE USED TO BRIEF 
BOTH USG PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES 
WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND IN THIS 
COUNTRY. END INTRODUCTION. 
 
3. PERHAPS THE SINGLE DOMINANT ASPECT OF THE PERSIAN 
PSYCHE IS AN OVERRIDING EGOISM. ITS ANTECEDENTS LIE 
IN THE LONG IRANIAN HISTORY OF INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY 
WHICH PUT A PREMIUM ON SELF-PRESERVATION. THE PRACTICAL 
EFFECT OF IT IS AN ALMOST TOTAL PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION 
WITH SELF AND LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR UNDERSTANDING POINTS 
OF VIEW OTHER THAN ONE\'S OWN. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT 
IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO AN IRANIAN THAT U.S. IMMIGRATION 
LAW MAY PROHIBIT ISSUING HIM A TOURIST VISA WHEN HE HAS 
DETERMINED THAT HE WANTS TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. 
SIMILARLY, THE IRANIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES NO INCONSISTENCY 
IN CLAIMING FORCE MAJEURE TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR LATE 
PAYMENT OF INTEREST DUE ON OUTSTANDING LOANS WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IT IS A PART IS DENYING THE VAILIDITY 
OF THE VERY GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE WHEN 
CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR CLAIMS FROM FOREIGN FIRMS FORCED 
TO CEASE OPERATIONS DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION. 
 
4. THE REVERSE OF THIS PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL COIN, 
AND HAVING THE SAME HISTORICAL ROOTS AS PERSIAN EGOISM, 
IS A PERVASIVE UNEASE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN 
WHICH ONE LIVES. THE PERSIAN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT 
NOTHING IS PERMANENT AND IT IS COMMONLY PERCEIVED THAT 
HOSTILE FORCES ABOUND. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EACH 
INDIVIDUAL MUST BE CONSTANTLY ALERT FOR OPPORTUNITIES 
TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MALEVOLENT FORCES THAT 
WOULD OTHERWISE BE HIS UNDOING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY 
JUSTIFIED IN USING ALMOST ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT 
SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS APPROACH UNDERLIES THE SOCALLED 
\"BAZAAR MENTALITY\" SO COMMON AMONG PERSIANS, A 
MIND-SET THAT OFTEN IGNORES LONGER TERM INTERESTS IN 
FAVOR OF IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE ADVANTAGES AND COUNTENANCES 
PRACTICES THAT ARE REGARDED AS UNETHICAL BY OTHER 
NORMS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE SEEMINGLY SHORTSIGHTED AND 
HARASSING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE PGOI IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH GTE. 
 
5. COUPLED WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IS A 
GENERAL INCOMPREHENSION OF CASUALITY. ISLAM, WITH ITS 
EMPHASIS ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD, APPEARS TO ACCOUNT 
AT LEAST IN MAJOR PART FOR THIS PHENOMENON. SOMEWHAT 
SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THOSE IRANIANS EDUCATED IN THE 
WESTERN STYLE AND PERHAPS WITH LONG EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE 
IRAN ITSELF FREQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY GRASPING THE 
INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF EVENTS. WITNESS A YAZDI RESISTING 
THE IDEA THAT IRANIAN BEHAVIOR HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE 
PERCEPTION OF IRAN IN THE U.S. OR THAT THIS PERCEPTION 
IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO AMERICAN POLICIES REGARDING 
IRAN. THIS SAME QUALITY ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN PERSIAN 
AVERSION TO ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE\'S OWN 
ACTIONS. THE DEUS EX MACHINA IS ALWAYS AT WORK. 
 
6. THE PERSIAN PROCLIVITY FOR ASSUMING THAT TO SAY 
SOMETHING IS TO DO IT FURTHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. 
AGAIN, YAZDI CAN EXPRESS SURPRISE WHEN INFORMED THAT THE 
IRREGULAR SECURITY FORCES ASSIGNED TO THE EMBASSY REMAIN 
IN PLACE. \"BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOLD ME THEY 
WOULD GO BY MONDAY,\" HE SAYS. AN MFA OFFICIAL REPORTS 
THAT THE SHERRY CASE IS \"90 PERCENT SOLVED,\" BUT WHEN 
A CONSULAR OFFICER INVESTIGATES HE DISCOVERS THAT NOTHING 
HAS CHANGED. THERE IS NO RECOGNITION THAT INSTRUCTIONS 
MUST BE FOLLOWED UP, THAT COMMITMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED 
BY ACTION AND RESULTS. 
 
6. FINALLY, THERE ARE THE PERSIAN CONCEPTS OF INFLUENCE 
AND OBLIGATION. EVERYONE PAYS OBEISANCE TO THE FORMER 
AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY HONORED IN THE BREACH. 
PERSIANS ARE CONSUMED WITH DEVELOPING PARTI BAZI--THE 
INFLUENCE THAT WILL HELP GET THINGS DONE--WHILE FAVORS 
ARE ONLY GRUDGINGLY BESTOWED AND THEN JUST TO THE 
EXTENT THAT A TANGIBLE QUID PRO QUO IS IMMEDIATELY 
PRECEPTIBLE. FORGET ABOUT ASSISTANCE PROFERRED LAST 
YEAR OR EVEN LAST WEEK; WHAT CAN BE OFFERED TODAY? 
 
7. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE 
WITH PERSIANS IN ALL THIS: 
 
- --FIRST, ONE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT HIS SIDE OF 
THE ISSUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED, LET ALONE THAT IT WILL 
BE CONCEDED TO HAVE MERITS. PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH 
SELF PRECLUDES THIS. A NEGOTIATOR MUST FORCE RECOGNITION 
OF HIS POSITION UPON HIS PERSIAN OPPOSITE NUMBER. 
 
- --SECOND, ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT AN IRANIAN READILY 
TO PERCEIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP 
BASED ON TRUST. HE WILL ASSUME THAT HIS OPPOSITE 
NUMBER IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERSARY. IN DEALING WITH 
HIM HE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO HIMSELF 
THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE. HE WILL BE PREPARED 
TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INCLUDING 
RUNNING THE RISK OF SO ALIENATING WHOEVER HE IS DEALING 
WITH THAT FUTURE BUSINESS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, AT 
LEAST TO THE LATTER. 
 
- --THIRD, INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL ASPECTS 
OF AN ISSUE MUST BE PAINSTAKINGLY, FORECEFULLY AND 
REPEATEDLY DEVELOPED. LINKAGES WILL BE NEITHER READILY 
COMPREHENDED NOR ACCEPTED BY PERSIAN NEGOTIATORS. 
 
- --FOURTH, ONE SHOULD INSIST ON PERFORMANCE AS THE 
SINE QUA NON AT ESH STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS. STATEMENTS 
OF INTENTION COUNT FOR ALMOST NOTHING. 
 
- --FIFTH, CULTIVATION OF GOODWILL FOR GOODWILL\'S SAKE 
IS A WASTE OF EFFORT. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AT ALL 
TIMES SHOULD BE IMPRESSING UPON THE PERSIAN ACROSS THE 
TABLE THE MUTUALITY OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS, HE 
MUST BE MADE TO KNOW THAT A QUID PRO QUO IS INVOLVED 
ON BOTH SIDES. 
 
- --FINALLY, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE THREAT 
OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND NOT 
BE COWED BY THE POSSIBLITY. GIVEN THE PERSIAN 
NEGOTIATOR\'S CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, HE 
IS GOING TO RESIST THE VERY CONCEPT OF A RATIONAL 
(FROM THE WESTERN POINT OF VIEW) NEGOTIATING PROCESS.

1. (C) - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. THIS IS AN INFORMATION MESSAGE; NO ACTION REQUIRED. 
 
3. MFA DIRECTOR FOR MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA KOKSAL, HAS TOLD US THAT TURKS HAD HEARD IRANIANS WERE PLANNING TO LAUNCH NEW MILITARY ACTION AGAINST CONCENTRATION OF KURDISH REBELS IN AREA NEAR IRAQI BORDER.  WHILE FOR THE MOMENT SITUATION IN KURDISH AREA SEEMS CALM, REPORT SUGGESTED THAT TEST OF STRENGTH BETWEEN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND KURDISH OPPONENTS WAS LIMITED BUT THEY HAD THE IMPRESSION THE KURDS, DESPITE LACK OF POLITICAL UNITY AMONG THE VARIOUS GROUPS, HAD MANAGED TO AMASS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ARMS AND COULD POSE A CONSIDERABLE GUERRILLA THREAT TO THE IRANIAN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FORCES. 
 
4. THE POSSIBILITY OF ARMED ACTION NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER ALSO RAISED THE QUESTION OF IRAQI RESPONSE.  SO FAR THE GOT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT GAME IRAQ WAS PLAYING VIS-A-VIS IRAN.  ON THE ONE HAND INSTABILITY IN THE REGION WAS AS UNHELPFUL TO IRAQ AS IT WAS TO ANYONE ELSE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT POINTS OF FRICTION BETWEEN A REVOLUTIONARY IRAN AND IRAQ THAT THE LATTER MIGHT WELL WISH TO STRENGTHEN ANTI-KHOMEINI FORCES. 
 
5. REGARDING TIES BETWEEN IRANIAN KURDS AND OUTSIDE COUNTRIES, KOKSAL SAID THAT THERE WERE MANY REPORTS, BUT NOT MUCH HARD EVIDENCE, OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE IRANIAN KURDS.  HE ASSUMED THAT OUTSIDE POWERS NOTWITHSTANDING PREDICTABLE DENIALS WOULD FEEL STRONG URGE TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN KURDISH ACTIVITIES.  REGARDING LINKS BETWEEN TURKISH AND IRANIAN KURDS, KOKSAL EMPHASIZED THAT RECENT PRESS REPORTS THAT TURKISH KURDS WERE PROVIDING LARGE-SCALE ASSISTANCE WERE TOTAL JOURNALISTIC FABRICATIONS.  TO DATE, GOT DID NOT HAVE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS ANY SUBSTANTIAL LINKAGE ALTHOUGH, OBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE KURDS IN IRAN WOULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON ATTITUDES OF TURKISH KURDS. 
 
6. BECAUSE OF THIS, AS WELL AS IN THE INTEREST OF REGIONAL STABILITY, TURKEY\'S OVERRIDING CONCERN WAS THAT IRAN MAINTAIN ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND HAVE A STRONG AND EFFECTIVE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  FOR THIS REASON THE GOT HAD NOTED WITH INTEREST AND APPROVAL CHARGE LAINGEN\'S RECENT STATEMENT AFFIRMING US SUPPORT FOR IRAN\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.

E.O. 12065: GES 9/17/95 (LIMBERT, JOHN) OR-P 
TAGS: PGOV, PINT, IR 
SUBJECT: PM BAZARGAN CRITICIZED 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS, PM MEHDI BAZARGAN 
HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF CRITICISMS FROM VARIOUS SIDES. HE HAS 
BEEN ACCUSED OF ANTI-CLERICALISM, OF INEFFECTIVENESS, AND OF 
GENERAL BUNGLING. BAZARGAN HAS ANSWERED THESE ATTACKS BY 
CLAIMING THAT THE SAME PERSONS WHO WERE CRITICIZING HIM ARE 
NOT ALLOWING HIS GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION. DEPSITE THESE 
ATTACKS, IT APPEARS THAT BAZARGAN STILL ENJOYS THE SUPPORT 
OF KHOMEINI AND WILL NOT BE REPLACED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) THE FIRST ATTACK ON BAZARGAN CAME FROM AYATOLLAH DR. 
MOHAMMAD BEHESHTI, VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS, 
MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN PARTY. IN AN 
INTERVIEW WITH PARS NEW AGENCY IN QOM ON SEPTEMBER 14, DR. 
BEHESHTI BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT AND PM BAZARGAN FOR FAILING 
TO IMPLEMENT A BILL ON THE FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
ACCORDING TO BEHESHTI, THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL TWO MONTHS 
BEFORE HAD APPROVED A BILL CALLING FOR THE FORMATION OF 
COUNCILS AT PROVINCE, CITY, DISTRICT, AND VILLAGE LEVELS. 
BEHESHTI SAID DR. BAZARGAN\'S GOVERNMENT FAILED TO IMPLEMENT 
THIS BILL, EITHER BECAUSE OF DELIBERATE PROCRASTINATION OR 
BECAUSE OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WEAKNESS. (DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER BANI-ASSADI TOLD CHARGE SEPT 17 THAT BAZARGAN\'S 
OFFICE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING THE REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL\'S BILL, HAD SENT A LETTER TO THE COUNCIL TELLING 
THEM THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED WAS UNREALISTIC BUT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK OUT A FEASIBLE BILL ALONG THOSE LINES. 
 
3. (C) LATER THE SAME DAY, THE MONOTHEISM PARY (HEZB-E- 
TOWHIDI) ISSUED A SEVEN-POINT STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE 
BAZARGAN GOVERNMENT FOR NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE. LITTLE IS 
KNOWN ABOUT THE HEZB-E-TOWHIDI EXCEPT THAT IT IS AN ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL GROUPING WITH POSSIBLE TIES TO AYATOLLAH SADEQ 
ROWHANI. THE CRITICISMS DIRECTED AT BAZARGAN INCLUDED: 
 
-  (A) GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENCE TO CRITICISMS OF IRAN IN THE 
FOREIGN PRESS, BOTH WESTERN AND NON-ALIGNED. 
 
-  (B) SEEKING POPULARITY BY PLAYING WITH WORDS AND BY 
OPPOSING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. \"PERHAPS YOU 
HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE IRANIAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IS LED BY 
THE CLERGY.\" 
 
-  (C) DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\'S BILL 
ON FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
 
-  (D) NEGLECTING TO FOLLOW AYATOLLAH ROWHANI\'S ADVICE ABOUT 
THE NECESSITY OF PURGING THE GOVERNMENT OF ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY 
ELEMENTS. 
 
4. (U) THESE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ATTACK ON 
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 BY REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND COUNCIL 
OF EXPERTS MEMBER ABU-AL-HASAN BANI-SADR. SPEAKING TO AN 
AUDIENCE IN YAZD, BANI-SADR ATTACKED BAZARGAN\'S ECONOMIC 
POLICIES AND ACCUSED HIM OF HINDERING THE WORK OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. BANI-SADR ALSO ACCUSED BAZARGAN OF: 
 
-  (A) REFUSING TO ACCEPT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. 
 
-  (B) BUNGLING IN KURDESTAN AND THEN TRYING TO CLAIM CREDIT 
FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION THERE. 
 
-  (C) OPPOSING THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKS, A FAVORITE 
PROGRAM OF BANI-SADR. 
 
-  (D) BURYING HIMSELF IN TRIVIA AND NOT ORGANIZING HIS WORK 
PROGRAM. 
 
5. (U) IN AN ATTACK APPEARING IN THE ENGLISH AND PERSIAN- 
LANGUAGE PRESS OF SEPTEMBER 16, TEHRAN REVOLUTIONARY 
PROSECUTOR AYATOLLAH AHMAD AZARI-QOMI CRITICIZED BAZARGAN 
FOR ALLEGEDLY ANTI-CLERICAL STATEMENTS IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
EULOGY FOR AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY ON 
SEPTEMBER 11. AZARI-QOMI (WHO ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION FOR 
HEALTH REASONS) SAID THAT BAZARGAN HAD SAID THAT TALEGHANI, 
UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS, WAS NOT OPPOSED TO 
THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION. ACCUSING BAZARGAN 
 OF WEAKENING REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, AZARI-QOMI SAID, \"IT IS 
VERY STRANGE THAT A DISTINGUISHED FIGURE AS MR. BAZARGAN WOULD 
MAKE AN UNFAIR ACCUSATION AGAINST THE CLERGY. WAS IT NOT 
TALEGHANI\'S GOAL TO UNITE ALL GROUPS, THE FOREMOST OF WHICH 
WAS A COMMITTED AND ACTIVE CLERGY? HOW CAN HE (BAZARGAN) PRAISE 
TALEGHANI BY STIRRING UP THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE CLERGY AND BY 
CONDEMNING THIS PROGRESSIVE AND ACTIVE GROUP AS REACTIONARY?\" 
 
6. (C) LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS OF BAZARGAN\'S SPEECH DID NOT 
INCLUDE THE STATEMENTS WHICH OFFENDED AZARI-QOMI. EMBASSY WILL 
CHECK FULL TEXT OF SPEECH (WHEN AVAILABLE) TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY 
WHAT PRIME MINISTER SAID. 
 
7. ALTHOUGH THE PRESS HAS BEEN GIVING WIDE PUBLICITY TO THESE 
ATTACKS, BAZARGAN\'S REACTION HAS SO FAR BEEN LIMITED TO A 
STATEMENT AT AN ECONOMIC SEMINAR (REPORTED BY ETTELAAT OF 
SEPTEMBER 16) THAT THE SAME (UNNAMED PERSONS WHO WERE 
CRITICIZING HIS GOVERNMENT FOR ITS INEFFECTIVENESS WERE THE 
SAME ONES WHO WERE INTERFERING IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND 
PREVENTING HIS CABINET FROM OPERATING.) 
 
8. (C) THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME (NOR WILL IT BE THE LAST 
TIME) THAT BAZARGAN HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK FROM MEMBERS OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. 
ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKS COMING FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND FROM 
VARIOUS PERSONALITIES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY PART OF ANY CONCERTED 
ANTI-BAZARGAN CAMPAIGN, THERE ARE ENOUGH COMMON THEMESE IN THE 
CRITICISMS TO INDICATE THE COMMON INTERESTS OF HIS OPPONENTS. 
THESE THEMES INCLUDE: 
 
-  (A) IGNORING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. 
 
-  (B) IGNORING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. 
 
-  (C) GENERAL INEFFECTIVENESS AND BUNGLING. 
 
9. (C) IT IS WORTH NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT NONE OF THESE ATTACKS 
MENTION AYYATOLLAH KHOMEINI BY NAME AND THAT NONE OF THE 
ATTACKERS NOTE ANY CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR HIM. IN PREVIOUS 
DISAGREEMENTS OF THIS KIND, BAZARGAN HAS HAD ENOUGH SUPPORT 
FROM THE IMAM TO OVERCOME CALLS FOR HIS DISMISSAL. IT IS LIKELY 
THAT AS LONG AS BAZARGAN CONTINUES TO HAVE KHOMEINI\'S SUPPORT 
(AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF HIS LOSING IT) HE WILL BE ABLE TO 
SURVIVE SUCH ATTACKS. BAZARGAN\'S SURVIVAL, HOWEVER, IS UNLIKELY 
TO MAKE HIS GOVERNMENT ANY MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THOSE 
WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OVER MOST OF HIS FUNCTIONS.

SUBJECT: SOVIET COMMENTS ON IRAN 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. AT DINNER RECENTLY SOVIET AMBASSADOR VINOGRADOV SPOKE CANDIDLY OF PGOI. HE HAS SEEN VIRTUALLY ALL KEY LEADERS. AS AMIR-ENTEZAM OBSERVED, \"IF YOU CLOSE ONE DOOR, HE COMES IN THE OTHER WITH A PROPOSAL OR SOME DEAL.\" 
 
3. VINOGRADOV HAS SEEN KHOMEINI FOUR TIMES. HE DESCRIBED THE AYATOLLAH AS A MAN OF GREAT RECTITUDE, A TEACHER DISINCLINED TO LISTEN AND LITTLE VERSED IN POLITICAL REALITIES DOMESTICALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY.  TALAGHANI, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, WAS MUCH MORE THE REALIST. VINOGRADOV THOUGHT SKHESHTI WAS THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND POLITICALLY SKILLFUL OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP. BANI SADR MERITED ONLY SCORN. 
 
4. THE SOVIETS THINK THE PGOI\'S MOST DANGEROUS PROBLEM IS THE KURDISH REVOLT, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE STAGNATED ECONOMY. VINOGRADOV FEELS THE IRANIANS ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THE KURDS WITH FORCE AND THE ECONOMY WITH DREAMY ISLAMIC THEORIES.  NEITHER WILL WORK.  ALTHOUGH THE KURDISH PROBLEM MAY EVENTUALLY BE SETTLED, THERE WAS A REAL PROSPECT OF SHORTAGES, UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHER SERIOUS ECONOMIC GRIEVANCES LEADING TO DISAFFECTION OF THE LOWER CLASSES FROM KHOMEINI.  IT HAS ALREADY STARTED, BUT THE PROCESS COULD CONTINUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS.  HE SUSPECTED THE IRAQIS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH IRAN\'S KURDS AND ARABS, BUT DISMISSED THE THOUGHT THAT THESE USSR MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCE IN BAGHDAD TO RESTRAIN THE IRAQIS.  \"THEY ARE JUST CRAZY PEOPLE.\"

SUBJECT: MODERATION:  DOES IT HAVE A CHANCE? 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. SUMMARY:  THE MODERATE IRANIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH 
WERE ACTIVE DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND WHICH HAVE A 
LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSITION TO THE SHAH, HAVE BEEN PUSHED INTO 
THE BACKGROUND BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO FOLLOW A 
NARROW AND AUTHORITARIAN INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. WITHIN THE 
PAST FEW WEEKS, MODERATE GROUPS WHO FAVOR A MORE BALANCED 
SOCIETY RESEMBLING A WESTERN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY, HAVE BECOME 
MORE VOCAL. WHILE NOT DIRECTLY CRITICIZING AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI, 
THEY HAVE FOCUSED THEIR CRITICISM ON SOME OF THE OBVIOUS 
FAILURES OF THE PRESENT REGIME. THE POLITICAL POSITION OF 
THESE GROUPS IS STILL PRECARIOUS. IT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH 
A FEW SECULAR SPOKESMEN, SOME LIBERAL CLERICS, AND SOME SMALL 
NEWSPAPERS. ALTHOUGH STILL NOT A MAJOR FORCE ON THE IRANIAN 
POLITICAL SCENE, THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ORGANIZE 
THEMSELVES ENOUGH TO EXPRESS IDEAS CONTRARY TO THOSE OF THE 
RULING ESTABLISHMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE ROLE OF SECULAR AND CLERICAL MODERATES -- THE HEIRS IS 
STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE. SINCE THE REVOLUTION FIGURES SUCH AS 
MATIN-DAFTARI NAZIH, FORUHAR, SANJABI, AND BAZARGAN HIMSELF 
HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY KHOMEINI AND BY HIS ALLIES WHO SHARE 
HIS VISION OF A THEOCRATIC IRAN. NOT ALL OF THESE SUPPORTERS 
OF KHOMEINI ARE CLERICS; THEY INCLUDE THE \"SECULAR MULLAHS\" 
SUCH AS QOTEZADEH, YAZDI, CHAMRAN, TABATABA\'I AND OTHERS. THIS 
GROUP HAS DOMINATED THE GOVERNMENT, THE PRESS, THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS. IT HAS 
HARRASSED AND IGNORED ITS OPPONENTS. BARZARGAN REMAINS 
POWERLESS; MATIN-DAFTARI AND NAZIH ARE IN HIDING; FORUHAR IS 
IGNORED; AND SAXJABI QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST AND LEFT THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
4. ALTHOUGH THE POSITION OF THE MODERATE PARTIES IS STILL VERY 
FRAGILE, IN RECENT WEEKS THEY HAS SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF LIFE. 
ALTHOUGH THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ORGANS, INCLUDING THE NEWSPAPER 
AYANDEGAN AND THE POPULAR HUMOR MAGAZINE AHANGAR, WERE 
SUPPRESSED IN AUGUST, THEY HAVE BEGUN PUBLISHING SMALL PAPERS 
SUCH AS KHALO-E-MOSALMAN (FROM THE MUSLIME REPUBLICAN PEOPLES\' 
PARTY); JONBESH (PUBLISHED BY ALI ASGHAR HAJ SEYYID JAVADI), 
JFBHEH-YE-AZADI FROM THE IRAN PARTY AND AZADI FROM THE 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT. ALTHOUGH THE CIRCULATION OF THESE 
PAPERS IS LIMITED AND THEY CARRY MUCH LESS INFLUENCE THAN THE 
THREE MAJOR DAILIES (SAYHAN, ETTELAAT, AND BAMDAD) THEY DO 
OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON EVENT -- A 
COMMENTARY OFTEN AT VARIANCE WITH THE OFFICIAL VERSION. 
 
5. FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THE MUSLIM REPUBLICAN PEOPLES PARTY 
(MPRP) HAS ORGANIZED FRIDAY AFTERNOON MEETINGS AT ITS TEHRAN 
HEADQUARTERS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST MEETING ATTRACTED ONLY ABOUT 
100 PEOPLE, EMBASSY POLITICAL OFFICER AND POLITICAL ASSISTANT 
ATTENDED OCTOBER 19 MEETING AND FOUND AN OVERFLOW OF OVER 1500. 
THE CROWD WAS LARGELY MIDDLE-CLASS AND WELL-EDUCATED. THERE 
WERE MANY WOMEN, SOME VEILED, A FEW CLERICS. THE SPEAKERS 
INCLUDED AHMAD ALIZADRH, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MPRP, 
AND KAHMATULLAH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I, LEADER OF THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS. ALTHOUGH THE AUDIENCE AND SPEAKERS HAD NO AFFECTION 
FOR THE OLD REGIME, THERE WERE FEW MENTIONS OF AYATOLLAH 
KHOMEINI, AND NO ANTI-AMERICAN STATEMENTS. 
 
6. THE SPEAKERS ELICITED THE GREATEST RESPONSE BY THEIR 
ATTACKS ON AKHUNDBAZI (CLERICAL MEDDLING), ON THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS, AND ON ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A THEOCRATIC 
DICTATORSHIP THROUGH THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIM. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS 
FOUND THE CROWD\'S PULSE WHEN HE SAID, \"WE WANT THE ISLAM OF DR. 
SHAR\'IATI; WE DON\'T WANT THE ISLAM OF ........)\" AND LEFT THE 
END EMPTY FOR THE CROWD TO FILL IN. BOTH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I 
AND ALIZADEH WERE CRITICAL OF THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH. THE LATTER 
SAID, \"THIS CLAUSE IS AN ACT OF TREASON AGAINST FUTURE 
GENERATIONS OF IRANIAN PEOPLE. WE HAD A REVOLUTION NOT TO 
PREPARE THE GROUND FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF DESPOTISM.\" sPEAKING 
PRIVATELY AFTER THE MEETING, MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I SAID THAT EVEN 
THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP HAS NOW REALIZED THAT IT WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO SELL THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE IN ITS 
PRESENT FORM. \"THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN 
DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. I HOPE THAT SOME KIND OF IMPROVEMENT WILL 
BE POSSIBLE.\" 
 
7. THE MODERATES, IN CRITICISING VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, HAVE FOUND 
SOME ALLIES AMONG CLERICS SUCH AS AYATOLLAHS NURI AND SHARI\'AT- 
MADARI WHO SHARE THE VIEW THAT SUCH AN INSTITUTION, IF NOT 
PROPERLY DEFINED, COULD LEAD TO A DICTATORSHIP. ONE OF THE MOST 
INTERESTING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THE ENTRANCE OF 
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI\'S SON, HOJJAT AL-ISLAM AHMAD KHOMEINI, INTO 
THE DEBATE ON THIS SUBJECT. IN THESE DEBATES, THE YOUNG 
KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN A POSITION WHICH HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE 
MODERATE VIEW THAT VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, AS DEFINED BY THE 
CONSTITUTION, CONTAINS SOME DANGEROUS AMBIGUITIES. EMBASSY WILL 
DISCUSS THIS QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL IN SEPARATE MESSAGE. 
 
8. IN PART, RECENT OUTSPOKENNESS OF THE MODERATES CAN BE 
ATTRIBUTED TO DISILLUSION WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE REVOLUTION -- 
ESPECIALLY TRENDS TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN, CLERICAL RULE. THE 
MODERATES HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S OBVIOUS 
MISHANDLING OF CERTAIN ISSUES TO ATTRACT ALLIES BEYOND THE 
NORMALLY MINISCULE CONTITUENCY OF GROUPS SUCH AS THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT, THE IRAN PARTY, AND TEH NATIONAL FRONT. FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE OBVIOUS FAILURE OF A MILITARY POLICY IN KURDESTAN HAS 
BROUGHT CALLS FOR RECONCILIATION, EVEN BY FIGURES WITHIN THE 
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS. A COLUMNIST IN THE NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE 
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEHRAN TIMES HAS URGED THE WITHDRAWAL OF NON- 
KURDISH GUARDS FROM THE REGION; THE TUDEH PARTY PAPER MARDOM, 
STUNG BY ACCUSATIONS OF SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN KURDESTAN, HAS 
CALLED FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. ONLY THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMIC 
REPUBLICAN PARTY, THROUGH ITS ORGAN JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI, HAS 
CONTINUED TO REFER TO THE KURDISH INSURGENTS AS \"AMERICAN 
MERCENARIES\". HOWEVER, THE IRP HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ISOLATED 
IN ITS POSITION. 
 
9. THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO ENSURE PERSONAL SECURITY, ITS 
CRUDE ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP, AND SCANDALS INVOLVING THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COURT SYSTEM -- LARGE-SCALE BRIBERY AND THEFT 
INVOLVING NO LESS A FIGURE THAN FORMER TEHRAN PROSECUTOR 
AYATOLLAH AZARI-QOMI HIMSELF -- HAS ALSO WIDENED THE APPEAL OF 
THE MODERATE MESSAGE. THE PAPER AZADI OF OCTOBER 18 PRINTED A 
BITTER ATTACK ON THE REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE SYSTEM ACCUSING IT 
OF IGNORING THEFTS BY ILYAVI, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PROSECUTOR- 
GENERAL HADAVI, WHILE SENDING PROSTITUTES AND SMALL-TIME DRUG 
SMUGGLERS TO THE FIRING SQUAD. THE RECENT ATTACK ON TWO 
JOURNALISTS AT THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS BUILDING LED THE ULTRA- 
ESTABLISHMENT PAPER ETTELAAT OF OCTOBER 22 TO WRITE A STRONG 
FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL ENTITLED \"LET US NOT REPEAT MISTAKES\", 
POINTING OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF QOM AND TABRIZ REBELLED IN THE 
SHAH\'S TIME BECAUSE FOR DECADES THEY HAD BEEN DENIED THE RIGHT 
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 
 
10. WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS ADD UP TO? MOST IMPORTANT, THE 
MODERATES OF THE IRAN PARTY, THE NATIONAL FRONT, AND OTHER 
GROUPS ARE ONCE AGAIN FINDING THEIR VOICE AND BEGINNING TO SPEAK 
OUT. IN DOING SO, THEY WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME SEVERAL MAJOR 
OBSTACLES: 
 
-   A) THE MEDIA REMAIN FOR THE MOST PART IN THE HANDS OF THEIR 
OPPONENTS. JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI BECOMES MORE RABID BY THE DAY, AND 
THE OTHER MAJOR PAPERS ARE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. THE RADIO AND THE 
TELEVISION, UNDER QOTEZADEH\'S OPPORTUNISTIC AND UNENLIGHTENED 
GUIDANCE, RARELY DEVIATES FROM ITS DAILY MENU OF PSEUDO- 
RELIGIOUS DRIVEL INTERSPERSED WITH PSEUDO-REVOLUTIONARY DRIVEL. 
 
-   B) ALL INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN TAINTED BY KHOMEINI\'S 
DENUNCIATIONS. HIS FAMOUS AUGUST DECLARATION THAT \"WE DO NOT WANT 
INTELLECTUALS\" IS STILL REMEMBERED. HIS DIATRIBES AGAINST WESTERN 
DECADENCE HAVE MADE ALL WESTERN MANIFESTATIONS, INCLUDING 
NICETIES, SUSPECT IN HIS FOLLOWERS\' EYES. 
 
11. THESE MODERATE GROUPS STILL LEAD A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE ON 
THE FRINGES OF IRANIAN POLITICAL LIFE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY 
ARE LEFT ALONE TO HOLD THEIR MEETINGS AND PUBLISH THEIR 
NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT TO THE POLITICAL 
PROCESS. HOWEVER, IN HIS MOST RECENT SPEECHES, KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN 
NOTE OF THEM AND HAS CRITICIZED THEM HARSHLY FOR THEIR ATTACKS ON 
VELAYAT-E-FAQIH AND ON THE CLERGY. IN A SPEECH TO TEHRAN RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS ON OCTOBER 20, KHOMEINI REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE MPRP 
MEETING, SAYING, \"RECENTLY, IN ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS, ONE OF THESE 
MISGUIDED ONES, WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ISLAM, SUGGESTED THAT THE 
COUNCIL OF EXPERTS SHOULD BE DISSOLVED. AND THE REST CHEERED... 
YOU, WHO DID NOT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTING (FOR THE COUNCIL) 
HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THIS... IT WAS THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO GAVE 
YOU (OPPONENTS OF VELAYATI-E-FAQIH) THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATEVER 
YOU WANT TO SAY. YOU WERE IN HIDING WHEN THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
WERE STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SHAH AND HIS FATHER. NOW YOU WANT TO 
DISSOLVE THE ASSEMBLY?... YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO. I 
WILL SLAP YOU IN THE MOUTH. STOP THIS AND JOIN THE RANKS OF ISLAM 
AND LET THIS COUNTRY PUT ITSELF IN ORDER.\" 
 
12. KHOMEINI\'S ATTACKS ON THIS GROUP ARE STILL ONLY WORDS AND ARE 
UNLIKELY TO TAKE THE FORM OF ALL-OUT REPRESSION INVOLVING THE 
CLOSING OF NEWSPAPERS, THE BANNING OF MEETINGS, AND THE ARREST OF 
LEADERSHIP. MANY OF THESE GROUPS AND THEIR LEADERS HAVE 
DISTINGUISHED RECORDS OF OPPOSITION TO THE MONARCHY - RECORDS WHICH 
ARE DIFFICULT TO IGNORE. HOWEVER, THE HARD-LINE CLERGY AND ITS 
ALLIES HAVE BEEN ISOLATING AND ATTACKING INDIVIDUAL TARGETS FROM 
AMONG THE MODERATES SUCH AS ??AZIH, METEN-DAFTARI, AND FORUHAR. 
 
13. AS THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO MISHANDLE MATTERS SUCH AS ARAB- 
IRANIAN RELATIONS, PROVINICIAL AFFAIRS, AND REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE, 
THE MESSAGE OF THESE MODERATE GROUPS COULD ATTRACT A WIDER 
FOLLOWING. PERHAPS THEY COULD FORCE SOME CONCESSION TO THOSE WHO 
DO NOT SHARE THE IMAM\'S VISION OF AN IRAN RULED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THE TEACHINGS OF THAT SPECIALIZED VIEW OF ISLAM HELD BY ONE SECTOR 
OF A MINORITY SECT OF THAT RELIGION. 
 
14. IN THE LONGER TERM, IF THESE GROUPS CAN PRESERVE SOME 
COHERENCE THEY MAY PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE TO A CLERICAL MONOPOLY 
OF POWER IN POST-KHOMEINI IRAN. AT THAT TIME THEIR REVOLUTIONARY 
CREDENTIALS MAY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT; BUT FOR THE IMMEDIATE 
FUTURE, THIS GROUP WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE ON THE PERIPHERY OF 
IRANIAN POLITICS -- ARTICULATE, INTERESTING, BUT WIELDING LITTLE 
REAL POWER.

REGARDING ACTUAL NUMBER OF WHALES TO BE HARVESTED

NOT TO EXCEED LAST YEAR\'S HARVESTS.  TOTAL COASTAL

END SUMMARY. 
- 
2.  (C) ON JANUARY 8, REGFISHATT MET WITH SUSUMU 
AKIYAMA AND KENRO IINO, DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
RESPECTIVELY OF THE FISHERY DIVISION OF THE ECONOMIC 
AFFAIRS BUREAU OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MOFA), 
AND DELIVERED A COPY OF THE FIVE TALKING POINTS 
GIVEN IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  BOTH INDICATED THE 
TALKING POINTS WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER WITHIN 
MOFA AND WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FISHERY AGENCY OF 
JAPAN (FAJ).  IINO NOTED IMMEDIATELY THAT FAJ 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CONSULTATIONS REGARDING THE WHALING ISSUE WITH USG 
OFFICIALS.  AKIYAMA STATED THAT \"NO DECISION HAS 
BEEN MADE\" IN GOJ REGARDING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF 
WHALES TO BE HARVESTED IN THE ANTARCTIC BY THE 
JAPANESE FLEET THIS SEASON.  HE MENTIONED THREE 
FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING AN \"APPROPRIATE\" 
HARVEST AS FOLLOWS: 
- 
(A) THE MOST RECENT HARVEST LEVELS SET BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) THAT HAD 
BEEN ACCEPTED BY GOJ (I.E., THE 1984 SEASON OVERALL 
QUOTA OF 3,027); 
- 
(B) CONSULTATIONS WITH CONCERNED COUNTRIES; AND 
- 
(C) THE FINDINGS OF THE IWC SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
AT THE 1984 IWC MEETING. 
- 
HE FURTHER MENTIONED HIS \"PERSONAL VIEW\" THAT THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OF THE CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE THOSE 
WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT GOJ WOULD OFFICIALLY 
RESPOND LATER TO THE U.S. BELIEF THAT \"THERE IS NO 
NEED FOR CONSULTATIONS.\"  AKIYAMA ALSO POINTED OUT 
THAT JAPAN HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING AN UNLIMITED 
NUMBER OF WHALES EVEN THOUGH THE FILING OF AN 
OBJECTION WITH THE IWC MEANS GOJ IS NOT BOUND TO 
ANY SPECIFIC QUOTA. 
- 
3.  (C) AKIYAMA SAID THAT GOJ AND THE SOVIET UNION 
HAVE EXCHANGED \"EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION\" TO CONDUCT 
THIS SEASON\'S WHALING FOR MINKE WHALES IN THE 
ANTARCTIC IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TOTAL CATCH WILL NOT 
EXCEED LAST SEASON\'S HARVEST LEVELS OF 3,027 WHALES 
FOR JAPAN AND 3,028 WHALES FOR THE SOVIET UNION. 
AKIYAMA NOTED THAT THE EXCHANGE OF INTENTIONS WITH 
THE SOVIET UNION CORRESPONDED TO THE ARRANGEMENT 
REACHED BETWEEN THE USSR, GOJ, AND BRAZIL 
REGARDING LAST SEASON\'S ANTARCTIC HARVEST, A 
COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE IWC SECRETARIAT. 
- 
4.  (C) SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE POSED REGARDING 
THE TALKING POINTS: 
- 
(A) IINO REFERRED TO THE LAST TALKING POINT, AND 
POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE ESTABLISHES A 1984/85 
HARVEST OF 342 WHALES FOR BRAZIL INSTEAD OF THE 
376 USED BY THE USG.  AKIYAMA THOUGHT THAT THE 376 
FIGURE PROBABLY INCLUDES THE TEN PERCENT IWC 
MARGIN OF ERROR THAT IS ALLOWED FOR WHALING IN 
AREA II, BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE 
OF THE USSR/GOJ/BRAZIL AGREEMENTS HAS  BEEN NOT 
TO PROVIDE FOR ANY MARGIN OF ERROR FOR THE 
HARVEST IN AREA II.  THUS, IN THE 1983/84 SEASON 
THE FIVE PERCENT MARGIN OF ERROR ALLOWED BY THE 
IWC FOR AREA II WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A BRAZILIAN 
HARVEST OF 630 MINKE WHALES, BUT THE GOJ/USSR/BRAZIL 
ARRANGEMENT LIMITED BRAZIL\'S HARVEST TO 600 WHALES. 
SIMILARLY, FOR THE 1984/85 SEASON, BRAZIL WILL 
HARVEST 342 WHALES IN AREA II, NOT 342 PLUS TEN PERCENT, 
OR 376 WHALES.  ACCORDINGLY, GOJ\'S QUOTA UNDER THE 
IWC GUIDELINES SHOULD BE 1,941 MINKE WHALES, NOT 
1,924. AKIYAMA AND IINO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THE 
USG REALIZED THAT A \"PAST PRACTICE\" CALUCATIONS 
WOULD ALLOW GOJ A HARVEST QUOTA OF 1,941 FOR THIS 
SEASON. 
 
(B) THE FISHERY DIVISION OFFICIALS ALSO ASKED FOR 
USG CLARIFICATION OF THE REFERENCE IN THE SECOND 
TALKING POINT TO THE NOVEMBER 13, 1984, LETTER OF THE 
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE REGARDING THE PHRASE \"IN 
EXCESS OF THE 1984/85 QUOTA FOR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE 
MINKE WHALES.\"  IN PARTICULAR, GOJ WANTS TO KNOW IF 
GOJ IS SAFE FROM THE THREAT OF CERTIFICATION UNDER 
THE PACKWOOD AMENDMENT TO THE MAGNUSON FISHERY 
CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT (MFCMA) IF GOJ 
HARVESTS FOR ANTARCTIC MINKE WHALES DO NOT EXCEED 
A CEILING OF 1,924 (OR 1,941) WHALES.  FURTHER 
ELABORATION ON THE SAME QUESTION WAS RAISED 
WITH THE COMMENT THAT USSR AND GOJ WHALERS BOTH 
OPERATE IN AREAS 4 AND 6 BUT ONLY GOJ OPERATIONS 
OCCUR IN AREA 5.  AS A RESULT, AKIYAMA AND IINO 
WONDERED IF THE TALKING POINTS WERE ONLY REFERRING TO 
AN OVERALL ANTARCTIC QUOTA FOR GOJ OF 
1,924 (OR 1,941) OR WHETHER THE QUOTA FOR EACH 
AREA WOULD BE EXAMINED IN ANY USG EVALUATION OF 
WHETHER MINKE CATCH LIMITS ARE BEING EXCEEDED THIS 
SEASON. 
- 
5.  (U) REGARDING REFTEL\'S PARA 5, AKIYAMA 
CONFIRMED THAT 106 SPERM WHALES, ALL MALES, 
HAD BEEN HARVESTED BY THE JAPANESE COASTAL 
WHALING FLEET THROUGH JANUARY 7.

         U.S. SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLICY 
 
1.  (U)  THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS (JANUARY 8, 
1985) CARRIED A LONG VERBOSE OVERVIEW OF 1984, THE \"ORWELLIAN\" 
YEAR (\"VIOLENCE AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE\") CREDITED TO DEREK 
INGRAM OF GEMINI NEWS SERVICE.  ONE PARAGRAPH MISREPRESENTS 
ONE FACET OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. 
 
2.  (U)  NINE PARAGRAPHS OF THE FULL-PATE ARTICLE DEAL WITH 
\"AFRICA\'S MOST DRAMATIC POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS\" IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA, AND TOUCH ON SOUTH AFRICA\'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES, 
ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND THE RENEWED ATTEMPT TO 
CREATE \"A BUFFERS REGION OF SUBDUED OR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORING 
STATES,\" BLACK UNIONS AND THE VIOLENCE IN SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN- 
SHIPS, AND BISHOP DESMOND TUTU\'S CONDEMNATION OF U.S. 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLICY.  THE OFFENDING PARAGRAPH 
READS QUOTE THE AMERICANS ARE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN MANY OF THESE 
MOVES IN A POLICY (OF) \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" AND ANOTHER 
PLANK OF THAT POLICY IS FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE 
NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, 
LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND.  THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN SWAZILAND, 
BUT THE OTHER TWO PROVED MORE STUBBORN.  BOTSWANA SAYS NO.  END QUOTE 
 
 
3.  (LOU)  DRAWING ON EXISTING GUIDANCE, EMBASSY PLANS 
TO SEND THE FOLLOWING LETTER OVER THE SIGNATURE OF THE PAO TO 
THE EDITOR OF THE BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS:  QUOTE: IN HIS \"VIOLENCE 
AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE,\" WHICH APPEARED IN THE BOTSWANA 
DAILY NEWS OF JANUARY 8, 1985, MR. DEREK INGRAM WRITES THAT ON 
\"PLANK\" OF THE U.S. POLICY OF \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" IS 
\"FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH 
OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND.\" 
THIS IS A MISSTATEMENT OF U.S. POLICY.  THE POLICY 
OF \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" INCLUDES AN EFFORT TO REDUCE 
CROSS-BORDER VIOLENCE BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS. 
IN THE CASE OF THE NKOMATI ACCORD BETWEEN MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH 
AFRICA, WE WELCOMED THE AGREEMENT AS A TURNING POINT AWAY 
FROM THE DESTABILIZING POLITICS OF CONFRONTATION IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA, IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH OF NEGOTIATIONS. 
FOR THOSE TWO COUNTRIES, A FORMAL POLITICAL AGREEMENT MET THE 
NEEDS OF BOTH PARTIES.  HOWEVER, AS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
STATE CHESTER CROCKER HAS SAID, \"THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS NOT 
PARTY TO ANY EFFORT TO IMPOSE A STANDARD FORMULA ON 
RELATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS.  EACH 
RELATIONSHIP IS DISTINCT AND STANDS ON ITS OWN MERITS. 
COEXISTENCE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS.  WHAT WE DO SUPPORT IS A REGIONAL 
CLIMATE OF DIALOGUE WHICH GIVES NEGOTIATON AND PEACEFUL 
CHANGE A CHANCE.\"  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THE RIGHT 
OF EACH OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S NEIGHBORS TO MAKE ITS OWN 
DECISION ABOUT THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENTS IT WISHES TO MAKE WITH 
SOUTH AFRICA ON THE BASIS OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY 
AND STRICT RECIPROCITY.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES 
THAT NO COUNTRY SHOULD BE FORCED TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT WHICH 
IT VIEWS AS CONTRARY TO ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS.  END QUOTE

SUBJECT: ANGOLANS IN SADF SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF, 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES, SOUGHT REFUGEE STATUS IN BOTSWANA AND 
APPLIED FOR THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  AFTER MEETING WITH 
EMBOFFS, THE MEN WERE SENT TO THE LOCAL UNHCR OFFICIALS TO 
REGISTER AS REFUGEES.  PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THEIR APPLI- 
CATIONS FOR REFUGEE STATUS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF\'S 32ND- 
BATTALION \"BUFFALO COMPANY,\" CAME TO THE EMBASSY SEEKING REFUGEE 
STATUS AND INQUIRING ABOUT THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM 
(SEPTEL).  THE TWO FAMILIES TOTAL 15 PEOPLE. 
 
4.  THE MEN, JOAO FAUSTINO SALES AND LASERU NHUKWETE, CLAIMED 
THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAD FLED SOUTHERN ANGOLA IN THE 
DEBACLE OF 1976, SALES FROM SA DA BANDIERA (NOW LUBANGO) AND 
NHUKWETE FROM LUIMBALE (NEAR HUAMBO).  BOTH MEN SUPPORTED FNLA, 
SALES BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING FOOD AND GUNS FOR THE 
FNLA. 
 
5.  FROM 1976 TO 1978, THE FAMILIES REPORTEDLY LIVED IN AN 
ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP NEAR RUNDU ON THE ANGOLAN-NAMIBIAN BORDER; 
ANOTHER ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP WAS LOCATED FURTHER EAST IN THE 
CAPRIVI.  IN 1978, THE SOUTH AFRICANS GAVE THE REFUGEES TWO OPTIONS: 
THEY COULD JOIN THE SADF, OR BE RETURNED TO ANGOLA.  THE 
REFUGEE CAMPS WERE TO BE DESTROYED.  SALES AND NHUKWETE JOINED 
THE SADF AND ENDED UP AS TEACHERS FOR ANGOLAN CHILDREN OF OTHER 
RECRUITS.  SALES TAUGHT PORTUGUESE AND NHUKWETE SCIENCE.  SALES 
HELD RANK OF LANCE CORPORAL AND NHUKWETE CORPORAL. 
6.  ACCORDING TO SALES AND NHUKWETE, THE 32ND BATTALION IS 
COMPOSED COMPLETELY OF ANGOLANS, UNTIL 1978 ALL FNLA SUPPORTERS. 
SINCE THEN, A NUMBER OF UNITA SUPPORTERS AND \"APOLITICAL\" 
ANGOLANS HAVE ALSO JOINED THE 32ND.  WHILE THE ENLISTED MEN ARE 
BLACK ANGOLANS, THE OFFICERS ARE WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS, WHO ARE 
EORCED TO LEARN PORTUGESE IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE.  (SALES AND 
NHUKWETE SPOKE PASSABLE ENGLISH, BUT FELT MORE COMFORTABLE 
TALKING IN PORTUGUESE WITH THE EMBASSY\'S REFUGEE OFFICER.) 
 
7.  IN NOVEMBER 1983, THE MEN SAID THAT \"SOUTH AFRICAN 
INTELLIGENCE\" OFFICERS ENCOURAGED THE FOUNDING IN WINDHOEK OF A 
GROUP CALLED \"THE SOCIO-CULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF ANGOLANS IN 
SOUTH WEST AFRICA.\"  THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OR NATIONAL CHAIRMAN 
OF THE ORGANIZATION IS ALLEGEDLY TIMOTYO VICTOR, A UNITA 
SYMPATHIZER.  THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS INTRODUCED TO THE 
ANGOLANS AT RUNDU BY A COL. VILJOEN (WHOSE NICKNAME IS 
\"FANAKOLO,\" THE NAME GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE USED IN SOUTH AFRICAN 
MINES, SINCE VILJOEN ALLEGEDLY WORKED IN THE MINES BEFORE JOINING 
THE SADF).  THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUNDU BRANCH IS JOAO APOLINARIO 
WHILE NHUKWERE WAS VICE-PRESIDENT AND SALES SECRETARY. 
ACCORDING TO A COPY OF THE SPEECH GIVEN BY THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER (EMBASSY HAS ENGLISH COPY WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED TO 
AF/S), THE PURPOSE OF THE REORGANIZATION IS \"TO PROMOTE 
FRIENDLY CULTURAL TIES AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE ANGOLAN COMMUNITY 
IN SWA...TO MEET FELLOW SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS OF WINDHOEK, 
TSUMEB, KATIMA MULILO, AND RUNDU AT SOCCER MATCHES AND OTHER 
SPORTS EVENTS.\"  EVERYONE WHO IS A \"TRUE ANGOLAN\" WAS EN- 
COURAGED TO JOIN THE ORGANIZATION. 
 
8.  IN NOVEMBER 1984, AN EXECUTIVE MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION 
WAS HELD IN WINDHOEK AND ATTENDED BY ALL BRANCH LEADERS AND 
A LARGE NUMBER OF SADF OFFICERS OF COLONEL RANK OR HIGHER, 
ALL BELIEVED BY THE ANGOLANS TO BE FROM SADF INTELLIGENCE.  THE 
ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE \"FIRST PHASE\" OF THE PROGRAM HAD 
BEEN COMPLETED AND THEY COULD MOVE ON TO THE \"SECOND PHASE.\"  THE MEN 
RECEIVED A LECTURE ON THE DANGERS AND THREAT OF COMMUNISM 
IN THE AREA AND WERE TOLD THAT ELECTIONS WOULD SOON TAKE PLACE 
IN NAMIBIA; THE ELECTIONS WOULD BE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE INTERNAL 
PARTIES AND SWAPO.  THE TWO MEN FELT THAT THEIR ORGANIZATION 
WAS BEING POLITICIZED AND THEY WERE BEING PREPARED TO TAKE 
PART IN AN ANTI-SWAPO CAMPAIGN IN NAMIBIA.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE SADF WOULD LEAVE SOUTHWEST AFRICA 
AND RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA; THE ANGOLANS IN THE SADF WOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH THEM, BUT NOTHING WAS 
SAID ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THAT. 
 
9.  SALES AND NHUKWETE THEN REPORTEDLY DECIDED THAT THEY HAD A DIM 
FUTURE IN THE SADF AND DECIDED TO SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA.  THEY 
OBTAINED TRAVEL DECUMENTS, TOOK OFFICIAL LEAVE FROM THE SADF, AND 
TRAVELLED THROUGH THE CAPRIVI TO KATIMA MULILO, CROSSED INTO 
ZAMBIA, AND THENCEOINTO BOTSWANA AT KAZUNGULA.  ACCORDING TO THE 
MEN, THEIR LEAVE EXPIRED ON JANUARY 7.

SUBJECT:  CHRISTIAN CHURCHES BOMBED IN TRIPOLI 
 
1.  (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS AGAINST 
CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS IN TRIPOLI DURING THE 
PERIOD JANUARY 8-9.  TWO CHURCHES, MARONITE AND 
GREEK ORTHODOX, WERE BOMBED ON TUESDAY, CAUSING 
SERIOUS DAMAGE, WHILE ANOTHER GREEK ORTHODOX 
CHURCH AND AN EVANGELICAL INSTITUTION WERE DAMAGED 
IN ATTACKS WEDNESDAY.  A CHRISTIAN CEMETARY WAS 
ALSO BOMBED WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
 
2.  (U)  ISLAMIC UNIFICATION MOVEMENT (TAWHIID) 
HAS ISSUED TWO CONSECUTIVE CONDEMNATIONS OF THE 
ATTACKS, NOTING THAT TRIPOLI HAS TRADITIONALLY 
BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF RELIGIOUS UNITY, AND DEPLORING 
EFFORTS \"TO FRIGHTEN THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF THE 
CITY.\"  WEEKLY MEETING OF ISLAMIC DAR AL-FATWA 
WEDNESDAY ALSO CONDEMNED THE BOMBINGS, AS DID 
BRIG. OTHMAN OTHMAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF 
INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES DURING A VISIT TO 
TRIPOLI WEDNESDAY. 
 
3.  (C)  CHRISTIAN NOTABLE AND LEBANESE FORCES 
CHARTER MEMBER, CHARLES MALIK, TOLD POLOFF THAT 
FOUR CHRISTIANS HAVE, AS WELL, BEEN MURDERED ON 
ROADS NEAR TRIPOLI, AND THAT CHRISTIAN RESIDENTS 
OF AREA FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES.  HE SAID THAT 
\"LEBANESE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY\" IS THINKING OF 
PREPARING A DEMARCHE TO STATE DEPARTMENT ON 
TRIPOLI VIOLENCE. 
 
4.  COMMENT (C):  AS ALWAYS IN BEIRUT, LIST OF 
POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS OF THESE ATTACKS IS A LONG 
ONE, BEGINNING WITH TAWHIID ITSELF.  MANY 
OBSERVERS ATTRIBUTE BOMBINGS, WHICH COME SOON 
AFTER RECENT DEPLOYMENT OF LAF INTO TRIPOLI 
AS PART OF NORTHERN SECURITY PLAN, AS EFFORT 
TO EMBARASS GOL (WHILE AT SAME TIME INTIMIDATING 
CHRISTIANS).  ELABORATING ON THIS HYPOTHESIS, 
CHRISTIAN LEBANESE EMBASSY EMPLOYEE FROM KOURA 
REGION HAS TOLD US THAT MUCH BLAME IS BEING LAID 
AT FEET OF STILL-ACTIVE COMMUNISTS IN TRIPOLI, 
WITH RATIONALE BEING THAT LATTER ARE TRYING TO 
DISRUPT SECURITY PLAN THERE AND PLACE THE BLAME 
ON TAWHIID \"PRINCE\" SHA\'BAN, WHO RECENTLY 
BOASTED IN A PUBLIC SPEECH THAT THE COMMUNISTS 
HAD BEEN CRUSHED IN TRIPOLI.  A SIMILAR ARGUMENT, 
HOWEVER, COULD BE MADE THAT TAWIID\'S MAIN RIVAL 
IN TRIPOLI, THE ARAB DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IS 
BEHIND BOMBINGS.
