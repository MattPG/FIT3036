REF: STATE 106206 CIRCULAR; STATE CA-3400 NOV 2, 1966 
 
 
1.  PRESS REPORTS AND VARIETY EMBASSY SOURCES CONFIRM 
NEW ARGENTINE LEGISLATION UNILATERALLY CHANGING SEAS JURIS- 
DICTION NOW UNDER ADVANCED REVIEW.  REPORTEDLY LAW WOULD 
ESTABLISH SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA, PLUS ANOTHER SIX MILES 
OF EXCLUSIVE FISHING JURISDICTION, PLUS ANOTHER EXTENDED ZONE 
OF \"PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION\" FOR FISHING PURPOSES.  DRAFT- 
LAW UNDER CONSIDERATION IN ARGENTINE SENATE BEFORE JUNE 28 
COUP WOULD HAVE DEFINED ZONE OF PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION 
AS \"EPICONTINENTAL SEA OUT TO 200 METER ISOBAR\".  IN SOUTHERN 
ARGENTINA THIS ZONE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES WIDE AND BLANKETS 
FALKLAND ISLANDS. 
 
2.  NAVATT STATES ARGENTINE NAVY THINKING OF PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION OUT TO 200 MILES (AS IN PERU, ECUADOR, CHILE) 
RATHER THAN EPICONTINENTAL SEA.  200 MILE LIMIT DOES NOT 
RPT NOT REACH FALKLANDS.  ARGENTINE NAVY OFF TOLD NAVATT 
\"200 MILE LIMIT SOON WILL BE STANDARD THROUGH HEMISPHERE\". 
 
3.  FONOFF OFFICIALS REFERRING TO RECENT BRAZILIAN AND US 
LEGISLATION HAVE INFORMALLY INDICATED DECISION ALREADY 
FINAL RE SIX MILE TERRITORIAL SEA PLUS SIX MILE EXCLUSIVE 
FISHING JURISDICTION, BUT THAT \"PREFERENTIAL JURISDICTION\" 
STILL UNDER STUDY.  TWO FONOFF MEN VOLUNTARILY AND INFORMALLY 
SOUGHT EMBASSY REACTION TO POSSIBLE EXTENDED PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION BY SUGGESTING THAT US IN FACT HAS ACCEPTED 
UNILATERALLY CREATED ECUADORIAN, PERUVIAN AND CHILEAN 200 MILE 
LIMITS.  EMBOFF REJECTED IDEA US ACCEPTS THESE LIMITS IN ANY 
WAY AND POINTED OUT 1965 AMENDMENTS TO AID LEGISLATION AIMED 
AT FURTHER PROTECTING US FISHING RIGHTS. 
 
4.  FONOFF LEGAL ADVISOR CONCEDES DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
\"EXCLUSIVE\" AND \"PREFERENTIAL\" FISHING JURISDICTION A SEMANTIC 
NICETY.  HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IN ZONE OF \"PREFERENTIAL\" JURIS- 
DICTION ARGENTINA WOULD CLAIM RIGHT TO TAX, LICENSE AND OTHER- 
WISE CONTROL ALL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EXPLOITATION OF 
RESOURCES OF SEA. 
 
5.  DRAFT LEGISLATION ON SEAS JURISDICTION LAY DORMANT UNTIL 
SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL IN FISHIN ARGENTINE EPICONTINENTAL SEAS 
BY CUBAN AND EAST EUROPEAN (ESPECIALLY SOVIET) VESSELS PAST 
SIX MONTHS ALARMED ARGENTINE ARMED FORCES.  (SEE NAVATT IR 
5-804-0-140-66 OF NOV 18) NOT RPT NOT ALL SOVIET VESSELS WERE 
FISHING OR FACTORY TYPES.  FONOFF SOURCES INFORMALLY STATE 
ARMED FORCES PRESSURE MAKES EMISSION NEW LAW IMPERATIVE, QUITE 
POSSIBLY APPEARING WITHIN NEXT FEW WEEKS.  WHEN ASKED BY FONOFF 
MEN ABOUT \"SECURITY PROBLEMS CREATED BY SOVIET TRAWLERS OFF US 
COAST\", EMBASSY OFF REPLIED US DID NOT RPT NOT SEE THAT 
UNILATERAL ATTEMPT TO EXTEND SEAS JURISDICTION OFFERED ANY 
REALISTIC SOLUTION FOR POSSIBLE SECURITY PROBLEMS, WHILE SUCH 
ACTION COULD CREATE NEW SOURCES POSSIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING AND 
CONFLICT. 
 
6.  RE PAR 3 STATE 106206 BELIEVE OUTLINED PROPOSAL MIGHT 
FORESTALL UNILATERAL ARGENTINE ATTEMPT TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXTEND 
\"PREFERENTIAL\" FISHING JURISDICTION ONLY IF EMBASSY CAN BE 
AUTHORIZED DISCUSS IDEA WITH ARGENTINES IMMEDIATELY. EVEN THEN 
CHANCES SUCCESS LIMITED BY (A) ADVANCED STAGE PROPOSED ARGENTINE 
LAW AND (B) PRIMACY SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ARGENTINE THINKING. 
WE WOULD BENEFIT SOME FROM FONOFF LEGAL ADVISORS\' QUALMS ABOUT 
UNILATERAL ACTION, AND FROM RESTRAINT OF RECENT BRAZILIAN 
LEGISLATION WHICH DID NOT RPT NOT GO BEYOND 12-MILE LIMIT. 
 
7.  FOR DISCUSSION WITH ARGENTINES WOULD MODIFY TEXT IN STATE 
10942 CIRCULAR TO:  (A) MAKE ALL REFERENCES TO ARGENTINA, VICE 
CANADA; (B) REFER TO PROPOSED ARGENTINE CLAIMS OF PREFERENTIAL 
JURISDICTION OVER WATERS WE REGARD AS HIGH SEAS; (C) ELIMINATE 
REFERENCES TO \"TRADITIONAL DISTANT WATER FISHERIES\", SINCE 
ARGENTINE COAST NOT RPT NOT TRADITIONAL FISHING ZONE (WHEREAS 
NO. 3);  (D) ADD NOTATION THERE NO TRADITIONAL FISHING AND 
CONFINE OPERATIVE AGREEMENT TO PROVISIONS FOR NON-TRADITIONAL 
FISHING; (E) ELIMINATE LAST THREE PARS OF AIDE-MEMOIRE HANDED 
TO CANADIAN AMB. 
 
8.  IF AUTHORIZED, ENVISAGE TWO-STEP APPROACH TO FONOFF. 
FIRST, INFORMAL AND ORAL, STRESSING OUR INTEREST IN FREEDOM OF 
HIGH SEAS, NOTING EARLIER FONOFF CONFIRMATION NEW LAW UNDER 
STUDY, OUTLINING OUR PROPOSAL IN GENERAL TERMS.  ON BASIS 
FONOFF REACTION, WE WOULD THEN COUCH AIDE-MEMOIRE IN TERMS 
WHICH WOULD APPEAR MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED.

REF: TEHRAN 1091: TEHRAN 263: MOSCOW 1603 
 
COUNTRY TEAM. MESSAGE 
 
 
BEGIN SUMMARY 
 
GENERAL AZIMI, MINISTER OF WAR, ON INSTRUCTION OF SHAH ASKS THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER HARD LOOK AT F-4E PRODUCTION LINE IN ORDER ACCELERATE DELIVERY OF ONE SQUADRON OF F-4ES TO IRAN IN 1972. REQUEST REFLECTS SHAH\'S INCREASING CONCERN OVER SOVIET AMBITIONS IN AREA AND ESPECIALLY THREAT SHAH SEES TO IRAN OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY IRAQ AND USSR. SHAH RECOGNIZES PROBLEMS THIS POSES FOR US BUT IS TURNING TO USG WITH THIS REQUEST TO GIVE IRAN HIGHER PRIORITY ON FA-4E PRODUCTION SCHEDULE BECAUSE HE REGARDS US AS MOST DEPENDABLE FRIEND. END SUMMARY 
 
ACTION REQUESTED: COUNTRY TEAM RECOMMENDS US REVIEW F-4E PRODUCTION LINE AND RESPOND FAVORABLY TO SHAH\'S REQUEST FOR 16 F-4ES IN 1972 FROM WHATEVER SOURCE MAY BE AVAILABLE. 
 
1. ON FEB 24 CHARGE WAS CONVOKED BY MINSTER OF WAR, GEN. REZANUZIMI, ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM SHAH. AZIMI SAID SHAH MOST DEEPLY CONCERNED AT TRENDS IN SECURITY SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST AND EXPECIALLY ON HIS WESTERN BORDERS. US OFFICALS ALREADY AWARE OF SHAH\'S CONCERN THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER AND OTHER GOI OFFICIALS (SEE REFTELS), BUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ SOVIET RELATIONS INCLUDING AGREEMENT TO DELIVER MORE MIGS AND OTHER MILITARY EQUIPMENT PLUS INDICATION THAT RECENT IRAQI-SOVIET TALKS IN MOSCOW INCLUDED CONSIDERATION OF FRIENDSHIP TREATY AS WELL AS INCREASED MILITARY COOPERATION INJECT NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN SHAH\'S TIMETABLE FOR MODERNINZING AND STRENTHENING HIS ARMED FORCES. MOST SPECIFICALLY, SITUATION REQUIRED IRAN ACCELERATE ITS MILITARY PROCUREMENT AND HOST PARTICULARLY DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT. 
 
2. AZIMI RECALLED THAT GOI HAD REQUESTED DELIVERY OF 16 OF F-4E AIRCRAFT NOW ON ORDER BY IRAN (FIRST OF WHICH WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY UNTIL AUGUST 1973) BE ADVANCED TO CY 1972. HOWEVER, GOI HAD RECENTLY BEEN INFORMED BY USG AND MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS THAT PRODUCTION LINE FOR IRAN COULD NOT RPT NOT BE ADVANCED TO MEET 1972 DELIVERY DATES DESIRED. SHAH WAS MOST DISTURBED, AS ADDITION OF F-4ES IN 1972 WAS VITAL TO IRAN\'S SECURITY AT THIS TIME. SHAH HAD DIRECTED THAT USG BE ASKED, IF PRODUCTION FOR IRAN COULD NOT IN FACT BE ADVANCED, TO MAKE REQUESTED F-4ES AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. SHAH\'S DESIRE IS FOR DELIIVERY OF F-4FS IN LOTS OF FOUR DURING JUNE TO DECEMBER TIME-FRAME. 
 
3. CHARGE REVIEWED RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN US-IRAN MILITARY COOPERATION, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT AND CREDIT, AND STRESSED THAT RECORD INDICATED WE UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED SHAH\'S CONCERNS AND DESIRES AND HAD BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY RESPONSIVE TO SHAH\'S WISHES. CURRENTLY, AZIMI\'S DEPUTY GEN. TOUFANS, WAS IN US DISCUSSING VERY QUESTION OF ACCLERATED EQUIPMENT ACQUISIION INCLUDING F-4E. ACCELERATION OF F-4E DELIVERY RAISED DIFFICULT TECHNICAL AND COST PROBLEMS AS WELL AS QUESTIONS OF OTHER COMMITMENTS AND PRIORITIES. UNDOUBTEDLY THESE ISSUES WERE BEING DISCUSSED IN FULL WITH GEN. TOUFANIAN TO ENSURE THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY INFORMED OF POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS AND REASONS FOR ANY LIMITATIONS ON MEETING GOI REQUEST THAT MIGHT EXIST. GEN. TOUFANIAN PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FULLER PICTURE OF SITUATION THAN WE NOW HAD IN IRAN. 
 
4. AZIMI RESPONDED THAT GOI WAS BEING KEPT INFORMED OF TOUFANIAN DISCUSSIONS, BUT DECISON ON F-4E COULD NOT BE DELAYED. AZIMI MADE CLEAR SHAH FELT AQUISITION OF 16 F-4E AIRCRAFT IN 1972 WAS MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE MILITARY PROBLEM OUTSTANDING. HE STRESSED SHAH BELIEVED THAT NUMBER REQUIRED WAS SMALL IN RELATION TO US INVENTORY, AND THAT UNSETTLED SITUATION CONFRONTING IRAN WARRANTED ACCELERATED DELIVERY TO IRAN AS AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE DISPOSITIONS (AS TO EUROPE OR EVEN USAF) IN SAME TIME FRAME. 
 
5. CHARGE NOTED WE WOULD TRANSMIT SHAHS REQUEST TO, WASHINGTON AND THAT USG IN SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH MARKED OUR RELATIONS WOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE RESPONSIVE. CHARGE SAID THIS SAME FRIENDSHIP REQUIRED HIM TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH WE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MEET SHAH\'S NEEDS AS SHAH SAW THEM, OUR MILITARY ADVISERS, AS GOI KNEW, WERE CONCERNED THAT ACCELERATION OF AIRCRAFT ACQUISITION WOULD STRAIN SUPPORT AND OPERATIONAL MANPOWER OF IIAF AND COULD LEAD TO DECREASE RATHER THAN INCREASE IN IIAF EFFECTIVENESS. AZIMI REPLIED THAT NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED HAD BEEN, CLOSELY STUDIED BY IlAF WITH MAAG ASSISTANCE, AND IIAF WAS SATISFIED THAT SIXTEEN AIRCRAFT REQUESTED COULD BE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED INTO PRESENT FORCE STRUCTURE. AZIMI CLOSED MEETING BY ASKING THAT USG ANSWER SHAH\'S REQUEST AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. 
 
6. COMMENT. SHAH IS DEEPLY CONCERN AT DEVELOPMENTS OVER PAST YEARS STRENGTHENING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND PRESENCE IN MIDEAST AND INDIAN OCEAN AND APPEARING TO INDICATE SUBSTANTIALLY ENLARGED SOVIET COMMITMENT, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY, TO IRAQ. HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT INCREASED PRESENT DANGER REQIRES IRAN\'S FIRST LINE AIR DEFENSE TO BE BEEFED-UP NOW RATHER THAN IN PREVIOUSLY PROGRAMMED SCHEDULE STARTING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THE NUMBER, FREQUENCY AND TONE OF DEMARCHES ON SUBJECT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS VIRTUALLY UNPARALLELLED, AND CAN LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT HIM CONSIDERS ISSUE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE. 
 
7. WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH SHAH\'S CONCERN, WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT REQUEST --LIKE USG DECISION IN 1970 ON SALE TO IRAN OF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH SQUADRONS OF F-4E --HAS BECOME ANOTHER GUT ISSUE IN SHAH\'S MIND. SHAH IS AGAIN TURNING TO USG BECAUSE IN PERIODS OF ANXIETY SHAH FEELS HE CAN LOOK TO US FOR COOPERATION AND HE HOPES THAT US AS RELIABLE FRIEND WILL FIND CHANCE BE RESPONSIVE ON MATTER HE CONSIDERS IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO IRAN\'S SECURITY. THUS USG CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST MUST RECOGNIZE THAT DECISION INVOLVES UNUSUAL DEGREE OF POLITICAL IMPORTANCE RELATED TO FABRIC OF USG-GOI RELATIONS. DECISION SHOULD ALSO NOT OVERLOOK OR UNDERESTIMATE IMPORTANCE OF IRAN FOR VITAL US NATIONAL INTERESTS. 
 
8. ACTION REQUESTED. COUNRY TEAM URGES THAT USG GIVE PROMPT AND SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION TO SHAH\'S REQUEST FOR 1972 DELIVERY OF F-4E AIRCRAFT, FROM WHATEVER SOURCES MAY BE AVAILABLE TO BE TAPPED (INCLUDING DELIVERIES TO USAF). WE RECOGNIZE THAT REQUEST MAY RAISE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS, BUT URGE THAT EVERY AVENUE BE EXPLORED TO REACH POSITIVE RESPONSE. IT IS ALSO MOST IMPORTANT THAT COUNTRY TEAM BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED OF PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS TO ENABLE US CONTINUE TO MEET AND TEMPER SENSE OF URGENCY ON SUBJECT WHICH PREVAILS WITHIN GOI. IF DELAYS OR BARRIERS TO FULLY FAVORABLE RESPONSE MATERIALIZE, WE TRUST THAT EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO BE AS FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE (E.G. PARTIAL DELIVERY IN 1972) AND THAT PERSUASIVE RATIONALE CAN BE DEVELOPED TO FULLY EXPLAIN TO SHAH REASONS FOR ANY SHORTCOMING. IN ORDER TO DIMINISH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IMPACT.

SUBJECT: TRIALS/EXECUTIONS OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT ELEMENTS: STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE AND SHAH LASHES OUT AT FOREIGN CRITICS 
 
1. IN PROTEST AGAINST RECENT TRIALS/PUNISHMENT (PARTICULARLY EXECUTIONS, WHICH NOW TOTAL 10) OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT-ELEMENTS, TEHRAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS -- LEAD BY FACULTY OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS-- MOUNTED ON-CAMPUS DEMONSTRATION AFTERNOON OF MARCH 7 AND EVEN LARGE ONE (CIRC 600) MORNING OF MARCH 8. WHILE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION FELT CAPABLE OF HANDLING MARCH 7 DEMONSTRATION WITHOUT HELP OF OUTSIDE POLICE, THEY APPARENTLY FELT UNABLE DO SO MARCH 8 AND CALLED NATIONAL POLICE ONTO CAMPUS FOR BRIEF PERIOD. RESULT WAS MUCH MANHANDLING OF STUDENTS BUT THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF ANY SERIOUS CASUALTIES/CLASHES, AND UNIVERSITY WAS QUIET BY EARLY AFTERNOON. 
 
2. SOME FACULTIES AT OTHER TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES (E.G. ARYAMEHR, NATIONAL AND POLYTECHNIC) ARE REPORTED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN SYMPATHY STRIKES\" MARCH 8 BUT SO FAR NO DEMONSTRATIONS REPORTED* THERE IS RELIABLE REPORT THAT DEMONSTRATIONS BY STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITY OF MESHED (SIX OF 10 EXECUTED CAME FROM MESHED AREA) BECAME SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT UNIVERSITY WAS CLOSED THREE DAYS AGO AND STILL REMAINS CLOSED. (COMMENT: WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF GOI ORDERS TEHRAN UNIVERSITIES CLOSED UNTIL AFTER NO RUZ HOLIDAY.) 
 
3. FROM COMMENTS OF STUDENTS AND OBSERVERS CLOSE TO ACADEMIC CIRCLES, IT SEEMS CLEAR LARGE PART OF MOTIVATION FOR DEMONSTRATION AND SYMPATHY STRIKES  IS STUDENT ANGER OVER GOI\'S CONTINUED DETENTION OF SEVERAL STUDENTS AS \"ANTI-STATE\" SUBVERSIVES AND, EVEN MORE, ANGER OVER RECENT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS OF THOSE CONVICTED OF ANTI-STATE ACTIVITIES. THERE ARE ALREADY INDICATIONS, HOWEVER, THAT GOI CONSIDERS TIMING OF DEMONSTRATIONS (PERHAPS DEMONSTRATIONS THEMSELVES) PROMOTED BY ANTI-STATE ELEMENTS TO EMBARRASS GOI DURING VISIT OF CHANCELLOR BRANDT AND HIS CONSIDERABLE PRESS RETINUE. 
 
4. IN RELATED DEVELOPMENT, WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR EARS OF STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS SHAH LASHED OUT STRONGLY IN MARCH 7 PRESS CONFERENCE (WITH GERMAN PRESSMEN) AT WHAT HE LABELLED DISTORTED FOREIGN REPORTING ABOUT TRIALS AND EXECUTIONS. HIM HIT AT LE MONDE VIGOROUSLY AND REPEATEDLY, AND TOOK PARTICULAR EXCEPTION TO LE MONDE\'S APPEAL FOR CLEMENCY FOR THOSE CONVICTED IN RECENT TRIALS. AFTER ASKING TWO RHETORICAL QUESTIONS \"HAS LE MONDE EVER ASKED WHETHER THESE MURDERERS HAVE RIGHT TO TAKE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE? HAS LE MONDE EVER WRITTEN ONE WORD OF CONDEMNATION AGAINST TERRORISTS AND ASSASSINS SENT BY IRA TO EXTERMINATE PEOPLE?\"), SHAH SAID FOREIGN PRESS HAS NO RIGHT GIVE ADVICE ON MATTERS THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. HE RECALLED HIS \"CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY\" NOT TO PERMIT \"TERROR OR ATTEMPTS AGAINST MY COUNTRY\'S SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY BY AGENTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.\"

SUBJECT: CONTINUING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN IRAN 
 
REF: TEHRAN\'S A-077 OF MAY 15, 1972: TEHRAN 3312 
 
SUMMARY: TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN IRAN SEEM TO BE INCREASING INSTEAD OF USUAL SUMMER SUBSIDENCE DUE TO VACATION FOR STUDENTS, PERHAPS INDICATING BETTER ORGANIZATION AND BROADENING OF APPEAL TO NON-STUDENT GROUPS. VIGOROUS ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN ON PART OF IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS IS NETTING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS BUT HARSH GOI POLICY APPARENTLY UNABLE BRING GUERRILLAS UNDER CONTROL AND MAY IN FACT BE HARDENING ATTITUDES OF GUERRILLAS AND THEIR SYMPATHIZERS. WHILE TERRORIST GROUPS NOT YET THREAT TO REGIME, GOI UNLIKELY SUCCEED IN HALTING THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT FIRST ADDRESSING BASIC QUESTION OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. DESPITE CONTINUING LARGE-SCALE CAMPAIGN ON PART OF GOI SECURITY ORGANS, URBAN GUERRILLAS ARE MAINTAINING RATE OF ACTIVITY. DURING PAST FOUR MONTH PERIOD THERE HAVE BEEN 28 CONFIRMED EXPLOSIONS (11 OF WHICH DIRECTED AGAINST US PRESENCE), TEN SHOOTOUTS AND SEVERAL OTHER INCIDENTS INCLUDING UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP DAUGHTER OF COURT MINISTER ALAM, AND PLOT TO SABOTAGE ISFAHAN STEEL MILL. OTHER UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS REPORTED ON ALMOST DAILY BASIS. 
 
2. IRANIAN SECURITY ORGANS, INCLUDING SAVAEEEAAA GENDARMERIE AND LOCAL POLICE, REACTING VIGOROUSLY AND WITH HEAVY HAND. DURING SAME PERIOD AT LEAST 16 GUERRILLAS KILLED IN CONFRONTATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, 13 OTHERS ANNOUNCED EXECUTED, TEN SENTENCED TO DEATH BUT REPRIEVED AND SENTENCE TO LIFE IN PRISON, NINE OTHERS GIVEN LIFE, AND 39 CONVICTED AND GIVEN SENTENCES RANGING FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS. ALL OF ABOVE TRIED BY MILITARY TRIBUNALS, AND MAJLES HAS RECENTLY PASSED LAW PROVIDING SPECIFICALLY THAT ALL THOSE ENGAGING IN ACTS OF SABOTAGE WILL BE TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WITH POSSIBLE SENTENCES RANGING FROM ONE YEAR TO DEATH. GOI HAS COMMITTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TO SO FAR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO CONTROL TERRORISTS--FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF OFFICERS NORMALLY DETAILED TO WORK WITH BNDD AGENTS ON NARCOTICS MATTERS HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED TO GUERRILLA PROBLEM. 
 
3. IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED IN TEHRAN THAT URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT A GREATER NUMBER OF INCIDENTS ARE BEING REPORTED IN THE CONTROLLED LOCAL MEDIA. BUT INCREASED RAPPORTAGE, WHICH MAY RESULT AS MUCH FROM REPUTED PRESSURE FROM LOCAL PRESSMEN ON GOI AS FROM CONTINUING GOVERNMENT DESIRE TO EXPLOIT LESS SAVORY ASPECTS OF GUERRILLA OPERATIONS DOES NOT COVER ALL INCIDENTS INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED BY EMBASSY LET ALONE THE MANY GUERRILLA ACTIVITY WHICH ARE RUMORED BUT NOT CONFIRMED. MOREOVER FREQUENCY OF UNCONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAS INCREASED BY A FACTOR AT LEAST AS GREAT AS THAT OF THOSE GIVEN MEDIA COVERAGE, LEADING TO PRESUMPTION THAT STEPPED UP TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS A REALITY AND NOT A RESULT OF INSPIRED PUBLICITY. PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN INCREASED GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS FACT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF INCIDENTS HAS CONTINUED INTO SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS, WHO HAVE IN PAST PROVIDED BULK OF RECRUITS FOR GUERRILLAS, DISPERSED FOR VACATIONS. THIS MAY MEAN THAT UNDERGROUND MOVEMENTS ARE BECOMING BETTER ORGANIZED AND ARE CATCHING ON WITH NON-STUDENT GROUPS, WHICH IF TRUE, WOULD HEIGHTEN DIFFICULTY OF PENETRATING AND CONTROLLING GUERRILLA GROUPS. 
 
4. DESPITE GOI APPARENT INABILITY TO SUPPRESS GUERRILLAS, EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT TERRORISTS AT PRESENT CONSTITUE AN IRRITANT AND EMRARRASSMENT BUT POSE NO THREAT TO REGIME. HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT TO US, AGAIN VERY TENTATIVELY, THAT GOI TACTICS OF HARSH REPRESSION AGAINST GUERRILLAS ARE NOT WORKING VERY WELL AND MAY PROVOKE SNOWBALL EFFECT OF ACTION AND REACTION PART OF SAVAK TERRORISTS, LEADING TO BROADENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE AGAINST SAVAK PERVASIVENESS AND TACTICS. EVENTUALLY REGIME WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS RESPONSIVE TO AT LEAST SOME OF THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMPLAINTS WHICH FORM BASES OF GUERRILLA DISSATISFACTION. WE DO NOT ENUMMERATE THESE COMPLAINTS HERE, PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY FORMED AND DEFINED IN OUR OWN MINDS OR EVEN, PERHAPS IN THE MINDS OF THE TERRORISTS THEMSELVES. MOREOVER, TERRORIST MOVEMENT IS NOT IDEOLOGICALLY OR ORGANIZATIONALLY UNIFIED AND NATURE OF THEIR COMPLAINTS VARIES FROM GROUP TO GROUP. WE SHALL BE EXAMINING FURTHER AND REPORTING ON THESE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT. MEANWHILE, WITHOUT SOUNDING ANY ALARM BELLS, THIS MESSAGE IS INTENDED TO ALERT THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE URBAN GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN IRAN CONTINUES TO BE A FACT OF LOCAL POLITICAL LIFE WHICH BEARS CONTINUING SCRUTINY. 
 
5. THE U.S. PRESENCE IN IRAN, WHILE TARGETED BY THE TERRORISTS, IS NOT THEIR PRIMARY TARGET AND SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE SUCH AS PRESIDENT NIXON\'S MAY VISIT (SEE REFTEL) OR THE JANUARY SAVAK TV SHOW WHICH PRECEDE LAST SPRING\'S SHOW TRIALS HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO BRING ON BOMBINGS AT AMERICAN INSTALLATIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING ALL REASONABLE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS.

TAGS: IR, PTER 
SUBJECT: CONTINUING TERRORIST VIOLENCE 
 
REF: TEHRAN 4887 
 
SUMMARY: FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION OF GENERAL SAID TAHERI, BOMBING AND OTHER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE. SAVAK MAINTAINING ITS POLICY OF WIDESPREAD PREVENTIVE ARRESTS AND, WHILE THIS RUNS RISK OF HEIGHTENING RESENTMENT AMONG POPULACE, OFFICIALS SEEM CONFIDENT THAT GUERRILLAS ARE ON THE RUN. WE ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE OFFICIAL OPTIMISM AND FEEL THAT SANGUINE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND THE GUERRILLA REACTION THEY USUALLY PROVOKE MAY FURTHER ERODE CREDIBILITY OF SECURITY ORGANS IN MIND OF PUBLIC. 
END SUMMARY 
 
1. IN WAKE OF SMOOTHLY HANDLED ASSASSINATION AUGUST 13 OF HEAD OF PRISONS BRIGADIER GENERAL SAID TAHERI (REFTEL) WHO WAS ALSO CHIEF OF AN ANTI-GUERRILLA SUBCOMMITTEE WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, FREQUENCY OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAS INCREASED. RECENT CONFIRMED INCIDENTS HAVE INCLUDED A BOMB IN A TEHRAN DEPARTMENT STORE WHICH INJURED THE TERRORIST PLANTING IT, BOMB IN TEHRAN NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY BUILDING WHICH KILLED WATCHMAN, APPREHENSION OF A TERRORIST IN SOUTH TEHRAN WHICH RESULTED IN ONE KILLED AND FIVE WOUNDED, AND SHOOTING TO DEATH OF THREE POLICEMEN IN A SMALL BAZAAR IN SOUTH TEHRAN. NUMEROUS OTHER BOMBINGS AND SHOOTINGS RUMORED BUT NOT VERIFIED BY EMBASSY OR CONFIRMED BY GOI. 
 
2. SAVAK AND OTHER SECURITY ORGANS ARE PROCEEDING WITH A WIDESPREAD AND, WE HEAR, NOT VERY WELL TARGETED ROUND-UP OF SUSPECTS, AIDED BY LISTS OF NAMES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FOUND IN DWELLING OF A RECENTLY SLAIN TERRORIST LEADER. POLICE NETS, WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY HAULING IN THE INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY, HAVE EXTENDED AS FAR AFIELD AS ISFAHAN WHERE A NUMBER OF SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED TWO WEEKS AGO. 
 
3. DESPITE INCREASING LEVEL OF GUERRILLA ACTIVITY, POLICE OFFICIALS REMAIN OPTIMISTIC. CHIEF OF NATIONAL POLICE LTG JAFFARQOLI SADRI ASSURED EMBOFF AUG. 17 THAT CURRENT FLURRY OF INCIDENTS CONSTITUTES DYING GASP OF GUERRILLAS WHO, HE CLAIMS, HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY TWO THIRDS IN PAST YEAR AND ARE FORCED TO ACT NOW TO SHOW THEY STILL EXIST. IN A MEDIA INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN LOCAL PRESS AUG. 19, SADRI UPPED FIGURE FOR REDUCTION OF GUERRILLA FORCES TO THREE FOURTHS, PREDICTED THAT REMAINING TERRORISTS WOULD SOON BE WIPED OUT AND REITERATED STANDARD GOVERNMENT LINE THAT GUERRILLAS ARE CONFUSED MISGUIDED INDIVIDUALS OF MARXIST-LENINIST BENT BUT WITHOUT GOALS OR PROGRAM. IN DISCUSSION WITH EMBOFF SADRI ATTACHED NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO MURDER OF GENERAL TAHERI, ASSERTING THAT TERRORISTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISIFED WITH ANY HIGH-RANKING OFFICER AND CHOSE TAWERI ONLY BECUASE OF IOSLATED LOCATION OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR LONG WALKS ALONE. SADRI ALSO DISCOUNTED POSSIBILITY THAT ASSASSINS WERE OF HIGHER CALIBER THAN RUN-OF-THE-MILL GUERRILLAS, POINTING OUT THAT SHOTS WHICH KILLED TAHERI HAD BEEN FIRED FROM 50 CENTIMETERS AND THAT \"A CHILD COULD HIT A MAN FROM THAT DISTANCE.\" 
 
COMMENT: WE CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAT TAHERI WAS PERSONALLY TARGETED DUE TO HIS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN ANTI-GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, SKILLFUL MANNER IN WHICH ASSASSINATION CARRIED OUT, REQUIRING CAREFUL PLANNING AND RECONNAISSANCE AS WELL AS DEFT EXECUTION, APPEARS TO INDICATE THAT THOSE INVOLVED WERE MUCH BETTER TRAINED THAN AVERAGE TERRORISTS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP BY THEIR OWN BOMBS. 
 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NUMBER OF GUERRILLA INCIDENTS WILL BEGIN TO TAPER OFF, BUT WE DO NOT SHARE SADRI\'S CONFIDENCE THAT HIS TACTICS AND THOSE OF SAVAK CAN COMPLETELY HALT TERRORIST ACTIVITY. IN FACT OVER REACTION AND TOO ZEALOUS A REPRESSION BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS SEEM AT LEAST AS LIKELY TO RECRUIT NEW GUERRILLAS AS TO STAMP OUT OLD ONES. IN ADDITION WISDOM SEEMS QUESTIONABLE OF SECURITY OFFICIALS MAKING PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT BREAKUP OF GUERRILLA GROUPS AND PREDICTIONS OF THEIR DEMISE. WE RECALL THAT THE LAST SUCH ANNOUNCEMENT LAST JANUARY WAS FOLLOWED BY SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS ON US-PROPERTIES AND OTHER SITES IN TEHRAN. IN OUR VIEW SUCH PUBLIC DECLARATIONS RUN RISK OF INCREASING CREDIBILITY GAP AND RESENTMENT ON PART OF PUBLIC WHO LIKELY BE INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE OF INDISCRIMINATE ARRESTS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE STAMPING OUT TERRORISTS. 
 
THE PROGNOSTICATION THEREFORE IS FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE TERRORISM BUT, DESPITE SUCCESSFUL MURDER OF TAHERI, WE DO NOT CONCLUDE THAT GUERRILLAS WILL NOW PLACE GREATER RELIANCE ON ASSASSINATION AS A TOOL. REASON IS THAT TERRORISTS STILL LACK ENOUGH TRAINED PERSONNEL TO PULL OFF ASSASSINATIONS ON REGULAR BASIS.

SUMMARY: AFTER APRIL 5 PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS 
EXPECT HAVE PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH SHAH. I PLAN 
LISTEN BUT IF SUBJECT OF PAKISTAN AND SHAH\' S CONCERNS 
REGARDING US/ USSR NEGOTIATIONS COME UP THIS 
WILL BE GOOD OCCASION TO PASS ON ANY THOUGHTS WE 
HAVE REGARDING PAKISTAN AS BHUTTO ARRIVING TEHRAN 
APRIL 7 AND TO REASSURE SHAH TOTAL ERA OF NEGOTIATION 
WITH MOSCOW DOES NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLY LESSENING OF 
TIES WITH IRAN. END SUMMARY. ACTION REQUESTED: 
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE BY OPEN OF BUSINESS APRIL 4 
SUMMARY OF OUR ECONOMIC AID TO PAKISTAN IN LAST 18 
MONTHS, HIGHLIGHTS OF RECENTLY REVISED ANNOUNCED ARMS 
POLICY TO PAKISTAN AND ANY OTHER POINTS DEPT OR ISLAMABAD 
THINK USEFUL TO PASS TO SHAH REGARDING BHUTTO VISIT. 
 
1. ON MORNING APRIL 5 I WILL BE PRESENTING MY CREDENTIALS 
TO SHAH. THIS OCCASION TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER 
AUDIENCES BEING SCHEDULED FOR APRIL DURING VISITS OF 
DEPSEC RUSH AND GENERALS GOODPASTER AND RYAN WILL 
PROVIDE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO SHAH MESSAGES OR 
THOUGHTS WE MAY HAVE ON: ( A) US/ IRANIAN RELATIONS, 
( B) DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND, ( C) ROLE 
IRAN CAN PLAY IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE. 
 
2. AT PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS CEREMONY SHAH\' S CUSTOM 
IS TO TAKE AMBASSADOR ASIDE AFTER CEREMONIALS FOR PRIVATE 
CONVERSATION. THIS BEING MY FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING 
WITH SHAH AS AMBASSADOR, MY INTENTION IS TO LISTEN TO 
WHAT SHAH HAS TO SAY. I ANTICIPATE SHAH, AS IS HIS CUSTOM, 
WILL TAKE ME ON ONE OF HIS \" TOUR D\' HORIZONS\". WITH 
BHUTTO EXPECTED IN TOWN APRIL 7, PAKISTAN WILL UNDOUBTEDLY 
COME UP. SHAH WILL PROBABLY CHIDE US FOR NOT HELPING 
BHUTTO ADEQUATELY. IF SO, I PLAN REMIND SHAH OF ALL WE 
HAVE DONE ECONOMICALLY FOR PAKISTAN IN LAST YEAR OR SO 
AND OF RECENT DECISION TO LIFT ARMS EMBARGO ON NILITARY 
ITEMS FROZEN IN PIPELINE SINCE 1971. TO THIS END WOULD 
APPRECIATE HAVING BY MORNING APRIL 4 LOCAL TIME BREAKDOWN 
OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN FOR LAST 18 MONTHS AND 
MAIN POINTS OF OUR PRESENT ARMS POLICY TOWARDS PAKISTAN 
AND INDIA. 
 
3. IN ADDITION GIVEN SHAH\' S CLOSE RELATIONS WITH 
BHUTTO AND INFLUENCE ON PAK PRESIDENT, ARE TTHERE ANY 
POINTS REGARDING PAKISTAN WHICH DEPT OR ISLAMABAD THINK 
I COULD USEFULLY PUT TO SHAH FOR HIS TALKS WITH BHUTTO. 
 
4. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED ZAHEDI\' S DESCRIPTION OF SHAH\' S 
CONCERNS, WE BELIEVE THIS TO REFLECT SHAH\' S WORRY OVER 
TREND OF EVENTS IN THIS AREA WHICH HE CONSIDERS HOSTILE 
TO IRANIAN INTERESTS AND HIS NEED FOR PERIODIC REASSURANCE 
THAT HE IS NOT ISOLATED, THAT HE CAN COUNT ON 
CONTINUED US INTEREST IN IRAN AND THAT ANY DETENTE 
ACHIEVED BETWEEN US AND USSR WILL NOT WORK TO IRAN\' S 
DISADVANTAGE. 
 
5. IF SUBJECT COMES UP I PROPOSE MAKE SAME POINTS AS 
DEPSEC RUSH MADE TO ZAHEDI AND ASSURE HIM THAT WE 
HAVE NOT AND WOULD NOT DISCUSS IRAN/ US RELATIONS WITH 
USSR WITHOUT IRAN\' S FULL KNOWLEDGE. 
 
6. FINALLY, AT APPROPRIATE TIME I SHALL MENTION 
PRESIDENT\' S DEEP INTEREST IN HAVING SHAH AND EMPRESS 
PAY OFFICIAL VISIT TO WASHINGTON DURING 1973.

OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT, GROUP, WHICH INCLUDED FILMMAKERS, CAMERAMEN

SUBJECT: SHAH ON CORRUPTION 
 
1. AFTER AMBASSADOR BYROADE\'S AUDIENCE WITH SHAH WAS 
FINISHED, I ASKED TO STAY BEHIND TO DISCUSS WITH SHAH 
APPROACH OF SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO SWEDISH AMBASSADOR AND 
OTHERS ABOUT ALLEGED INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OPPOSITION TO 
GOI AS RESULT SHAH\'S RECENT DECREES ON CORRUPTION AND ON 
NEW REQUIREMENT THAT GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND IMMEDIATE 
SUBORDINATES DIVEST THEMSELVES OF ANY SHARES THEY HOLD IN 
ANY COMPANIES OR INDUSTRIES. SHAH WAS OBVIOUSLY STARTLED 
TO LEARN THAT SOVIETS WERE CLAIMING TO NOTE INCREASED 
OPPOSITION AND ASKED RHETORICALLY HOW ANYONE COULD IMAGINE 
SUCH A THING. WE AGREED THAT THIS WAS SOVIET PSYCHOLOGICAL 
WARFARE DESIGNED TO UNSETTLE THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
THE SHAH IMMEDIATELY TIED IT IN TO THE RECENT 
TUDEH PARTY/IRAQI COMMUNIST PROCLAMATION CRITICIZING GOI 
ACTIVITIES. SHAH IS CONVINCED THAT SOVIETS ARE ATTEMPTING 
TO RECREATE TUDEH PARTY AND PUT MONEY INTO STRENGTHENING 
OF IRANIAN COMMUNIST MOVEMENT. 
 
2. BEING PENSIVE FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT WE HAD BEEN 
DISCUSSING, THE SHAH SAID, \"PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN TOO TOUGH 
ON CORRUPTION.\" TO WHICH I IMMEDIATELY REPLIED, \"NO, SIR, 
YOU CANNOT BE TOO TOUGH ON CORRUPTION.\" THERE THEN ENSUED 
A DISCUSSION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN IRAN IN THE YEARS AHEAD 
IF CORRUPTION IS NOT STEMMED WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
FLOATING AROUND IN THE ECONOMY. IT WAS QUITE CLEAR FROM 
THIS DISCUSSION THAT THE SHAH INDEED IS CONVINCED THAT HIS 
PROGRAM AND THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE WILL GO RIGHT DOWNHILL 
IF HE IS NOT ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION ISSUE. 
 
3. WHEN THE SHAH MENTIONED HIS INSISTENCE THAT CERTAIN 
HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DIVEST THEMSELVES OF STOCKS 
AND HOLDINGS, I SAID, \"WON\'T MANY OF THEM HAVE TO UNLOAD?\" 
THE SHAH REPLIED, \"A FEW, NOT ALL.\"

SUBJECT: IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY CREATED BY SHAH 
 
SUMMARY: CREATION OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY ANNOUNCED BY SHAH 
MARCH 2 IS MOVE TO SEEK BROADER SUPPORT FOR MONARCHY AND THE SHAHPEOPLE 
REVOLUTION. ALL IRANIANS OF VOTING AGE ARE EXPECTED TO 
EXPRESS ALLEGIANCE TO NEW PARTY OR RISK BEING VIEWED AS OPPONENTS 
OF SHAH AND EVEN TRAITORS WHO SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON. 
SHAH EXPLAINED IRAN\'S RETURN TO SINGLE PARTY SYSTEM AS NECESSARY 
BECAUSE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES UNQTE BY SOME IRANIANS SHOWED NEED 
FOR IRANIANS TO CLOSE RANKS IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE QTE GREAT 
CIVILIZATION, UNQTE AND BECAUSE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAD FAILED. 
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR SUMMER WILL APPARENTLY BE HELD, BUT IT IS 
NOT CLEAR HOW THEY WILL BE ORGANIZED. NET RESULT IS TO MAKE 
IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM LESS FLEXIBLE. INTERNATIONAL REACTION 
WILL PROBABLY RANGE FROM INDIFFERENCE TO CHARGES OF INCREASED 
TOTALITARIANISM. SHAH APPARENTLY PLANS TO CONTINUE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT 
IN DAILY POLITICAL AFFAIRS. THIS IS CONTRARY TO EARLIER SUGGESTIONS 
THAT HE MIGHT BE MOVING GRADUALLY TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO 
BROAD POLICY GUIDANCE AND LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION TO GOVERNMENT. END

AIRGRAM) ESTABLISHED IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. NEW PARTY WILL 
ABSORB RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY, LOYAL OPPOSITION MARDOM PARTY, 
AND THE ULTRA-NATIONALIST PAN IRANIST PARTY AND ITS SPLINTER 
GROUP THE IRANIANS PARTY. PRIME MINISTER HOVEYDA IS TO BE SECRETARY 
GENERAL FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS. SHAH WILL LATER 
PROPOSE CHAIRMAN OF NEW PARTY\'S EXECUTIVE BOARD AND PRESIDENT FOR 
ITS POLITICAL BUREAU. A PARTY CONGRESS WILL BE HELD, PERHAPS 
WITHIN TWO MONTHS. GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD THIS SUMMER 
UNDER AUSPICES OF NEW PARTY. 
 
2. SHAH\'S STATEMENT BEGAN WITH FAMILIAR RECITATION OF IRAN\'S 
GROWING SELF-RELIANCE AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE CONTRASTING SHARPLY 
WITH ITS RELATIVE WEAKNESS IN FIRST HALF OF CENTURY. HE NOTED THAT 
OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE CREATED IN RESPONSE TO HIS OWN WISHES 
AND COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN FACED WITH A DIFFICULT TASK. 
SHAH OBSERVED THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO FULFILL THEIR PROPER ROLE. HE 
COMMENTED THAT SOME IRANIANS HAD MADE QTE SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES 
UNQTE WHICH REFLECTED A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF IRAN\' GOALS. IN 
ORDER TO WELD ALL IRANIANS TOGETHER IN PURSUIT OF GOALS OF THE 
SHAH-PEOPLE REVOLUTION, HE HAD, THEREFORE, DECIDED TO CREATE NEW 
ORGANIZATION WHICH WOULD SUPPRESS PARTY DIFFERENCES. ONLY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR MEMBERSHIP IN NEW ORGANIZATION WOULD BE LOYALTY TO (1) 
MONARCHY, (2) IRAN\'S CONSTITUTION, AND (3) SIXTH OF BAHMAN (SHAHPEOPLE) 
REVOLUTION. HE SPECIFICALLY SAID NEW PARTY WOULD FOSTER 
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, AND HE PREDICTED THAT POLITICAL WINGS 
WOULD EVOLVE WITHIN NEW PARTY. HE URGED ALL IRANIANS ELIGIBLE TO 
VOTE TO ENTER INTO NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURE OR CLARIFY THEIR POSITION. 
BY THIS HE MEANT THAT THOSE WHO COULD NOT AGREE WITH THE 
THREE PRINCIPLES SHOULD LEAVE IRAN OR GO TO PRISON AS TRAITORS 
UNLESS THEY OPENLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL AND WERE NOT ANTINATIONAL. 
IF DISAPPROVAL IS IDEOLOGICAL, PERSON WOULD REMAIN FREE 
IN IRAN BUT QTE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS UNQTE. FULL 
PARTICIPATION IN IRAN\'S PROGRESS WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE MEMBERSHIP 
IN THE IRAN RESURGENCE PARTY. HE SAID IT WAS HIS EXPECTATION 
THAT WORKERS, FARMERS, AND TEACHERS WOULD BE THE FIRST GROUPS TO 
ANNOUNCE THEIR LOYALTY TO THE NEW PARTY. 
 
3. COMMENT: ABOVE ALL, SHAH\'S ACTION IN RETURNING TO SINGLE PARTY 
SYSTEM OF 1964-67 PERIOD SHOWS HIS EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CRITICISM 
AND STRONG DESIRE TO RECEIVE OVERT EVIDENCE OF POPULAR SUPPORT. 
AFTER HE EXPERIMENTED WITH TAME OPPOSITION PARTIES IN 
1956-64 PERIOD WITH POOR RESULTS, SHAH THEN TURNED TO HASSAN ALI 
MANSUR\'S PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY TO CREATE IRAN NOVIN PARTY AS INSTRUMENT 
TO IMPLEMENT HIS SIXTH OF BAHMAN REVOLUTION. MARDOM PARTY 
WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REJUVENATED TO STIMULATE IRAN NOVIN TO PERFORM 
MORE EFFECTIVELY. DESPITE CONSTANT STATEMENTS OF LOYALTY TO SHAH 
AND HIS PLANS FOR IRAN, PARTIES HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PLEASED HIM. 
AS INDICATED BY FAILURES OF FORMER MARDOM PARTY SECRETARIES 
GENERAL ALI NAQI AND NASSER AMERI, EVEN ACTIVITIES OF GELDED 
OPPOSITION HAD PROVED TOO CRITICAL FOR SHAH\'S TASTE. NEVERTHELESS 
HIS PAST STATEMENTS INDICATED CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR COCCEPT OF 
MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM IN IRAN, AND IMPERIAL DECISION TO INSTITUTE ONEPARTY 
STATE REPRESENTS 180-DEGREE SHIFT IN POLICY WHICH ALSO 
APPEARS TO NEGATE EARLIER PROMISES OF FREER ELECTIONS LATER THIS 
YEAR. KEY SECTION OF SPEECH IS COMMENT THAT HE HAD HEARD QTE SOME 
REALLY SHAMEFUL UTTERANCES, WHICH IN NOW WAY SHOULD BE EXPECTED 
FROM AN IRANIAN. THIS SCENE, OF COURSE, HAS ALWAYS RECURRED WHEN 
IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE DEFENCE OF ITS RIGHTS AT A HISTORIC 
JUNCTURE. THIS SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE, UNQTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WE DOUBT THAT MUCH CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WILL EMERGE 
FROM THE IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY. 
 
4. IN OPERATIONAL TERMS LITTLE HAS CHANGED, FOR DESPITE FACADE OF 
QTE ME-TOO UNQTE OPPOSITION PARTIES SHAH HAS ALWAYS CALLED THE 
TUNE AND ONLY RULING IRAN NOVIN PARTY HAD ANY IMPORTANCE. PRIME 
MINISTER HAS BEEN LEAD DANCER, AND HIS SELECTION AS SECGEN AT 
JANUARY PARTY CONGRESS HAD TIED IRAN NOVIN PARTY EVEN CLOSER TO 
SHAH. IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF NEW MOVE HAS BEEN FLOOD OF STATEMENTS 
OF LOYALTY TO SHAH, CONSTITUTION AND REVOLUTION, BOTH BY 
GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS CLEARLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR 
IRANIANS WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN IRAN\'S DEVELOPMENT 
AND SHARE ITS PROSPERITY. ALL DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT 
SHAH\'S PLAN FOR IRAN WILL BE SUPPRESSED UNTIL NEW PARTY 
DEVELOPS AN IDEOLOGY AND ITS LEADERSHIP IS CONSTITUTED. 
 
5. SHAH\'S SPEECH IS VAGUE ON GOALS OF IRANIAN RESURGENCE PARTY AND 
MANY OTHER POINTS. IT IS NOT CLEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CANDIDATES 
WILL BE SELECTED FOR SUMMER ELECTIONS AND ON WHAT PLATFORMS THEY 
WILL RUN. SPEECH SHOWS SIGNS OF HURRIED PREPARATION FOR ISSUANCE 
PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR ALGIERS. WHILE MOST IRANIANS WILL 
ACCEPT NEW CHANGE WITH TYPICAL CYNICISM, IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ALL 
PARTIES FOR FAILING TO GET BEHIND SHAH\'S PUSH FOR REVOLUTION FROM 
THE TOP MAY ALIENATE SOME PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE 
WORKED HARD FOR IRAN NOVIN PARTY ON ASSUMPTION THEY WERE CARRYING 
OUT SHAH\'S WISHES. 
 
6. INTERNATIONAL REACTION WILL PROBABLY VARY FROM INDIFFERENCE TO 
INCREASINGLY SHRILL CHARGES OF TOTALITARIANISM. IRAN\'S IMAGE AS 
COUNTRY IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS WERE BEING TAPPED IN DEVELOPMENT 
PROCESS MAY SUFFER UNLESS NEW PARTY\'S MEMBERSHIP COMES FROM BROAD 
SPECTRUM. IT APPEARS THAT EARLIER SUCCESSFUL IRANIAN POLICY OF 
COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY QTE TAKE IT OR 
LEAVE IT UNQTE STANCE IN DEALING WITH OPPOSITION. 
 
7. IN A-19 EMBASSY NOTED THAT SHAH HOPES TO MOVE TOWARD SITUATION 
IN WHICH HE GIVES POLICY GUIDANCE BUT KEEPS HIS DISTANCE FROM 
DAILY ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT. INITAL IMPRESSION OF HIS ACTION IN 
CREATING NEW POLITICAL PARTY AND FORECASTING HIS PERSONAL SELECTION 
OF SOME OF ITS LEADERS IS THAT HE HAS RETURNED TO MORE DIRECT 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. BETTER JUDGMENT ON THIS 
POINT CAN BE MADE WHEN FUNCTION OF NEW PARTY BECOME CLEAR. 
 
8. IN SUM, GIVEN EXISTING STRICT DEGREE OF POLITICAL CONTROLS, 
SHAH\'S DECISION TO MELD ALL POLITICAL PARTIES INTO ONE APPEARS TO 
OFFER LITTLE IN WAY OF IMPROVEMENTS TO IRANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM 
WHILE ADDING SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

SUBJ: SERIOUS RELIGIOUS DISSIDENCE IN QOM 
 
1. IN MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT OF THIS SORT FOR YEARS, 5 
DEMONSTRATORS WERE SHOT DEAD AND 9 INJURED WHEN POLICE 
OPENED FIRE ON A CROWD ATTEMPTING TO OCCUPY A POLICE 
STATION IN THE HIGHLY RELIGIOUS CITY OF QOM JAN 9. A 
POLICE OFFICE AND 3 POLICEMEN WERE INJURED BY THE 
DEMONSTRATORS AND ONE 13 YEAR BOY WAS TRAMPLED TO DEATH 
IN THE STAMPEDE THAT FOLLOWED THE SHOOTING. 
 
2. INCIDENT OCCURRED ON ANNIVERSARY OF LAND REFORM 
LEGISLATION PASSED IN 1963. IT FOLLOWED A MUCH MILDER 
PROTEST BY STUDENTS OF RELIGION SHOUTING ANTI-NATIONAL 
SLOGANS ON JAN 7 THE 42ND ANNIVERSARY OF REZA SHAH\'S 
DECREE ABOLISHING THE VEIL FOR WOMEN. 
 
3. ON THE 9TH A MOB OF PROTESTORS ARMED WITH STONES, 
IRON BARS, AND WOODEN STAVES REPORTEDLY RAMPAGED THROUGH 
THE STREETS SMASHING WINDOWS OF SHOPS AND DESTROYING 
PREMISES OF REASTAKHIZ PARTY HEADQUARTERS. THEY THEN 
TRIED TO TAKE OVER A POLICE STATION, DAMAGING POLICE 
VEHICLES OUTSIDE. POLICE WARNINGS AND WARNING SHOTS INTO 
THE AIR WENT UNHEEDED, AND POLICE THEN FIRED INTO THE 
CROWD. 
 
4. INFORMATION ON THIS INCIDENT WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS 
BY PARS NEW AGENCY AFTERNOON JAN 10. SAME INFORMATION WAS 
GIVEN TO DCM BY COURT MINISTER HOVEYDA AT SHAH\'S DINNER 
THAT EVENING FOR VISITING CODE. 
 
5. COMMENT: DEMONSTRATIONS ARE BEING ASCRIBED BY POLICE 
AUTHORITIES -- ACCURATELY WE BELIEVE -- TO CONSERVATIVE 
RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION ELEMENTS (THOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY TO 
FOLLOWERS OF KHOMEINI OR TO ISLAMIC MARXISTS AS SUCH). 
THIS IS FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS, IN OUR RECOLLECTION, 
THAT POLICE HAVE KILLED SEVERAL DEMONSTRATORS BY FIRING 
INTO A CROWD. SEVERITY OF THIS INCIDENT WOULD APPEAR TO 
ARGUE AGAINST THOSE AMONG THE JOURNALISTS AND OTHER 
OBSERVERS HERE WHO HAVE SUSPECTED MANY RECENT INCIDENTS 
WERE COOKED UP BY IRANIAN SECURITY FORCES TO IMPRESS THE 
SHAH AND/OR USG. BY THE SAME TOKEN, IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
CONCLUDE THAT RELATIVE POLICE LENIENCY, AS FOR EXAMPLE IN 
LACK OF EFFECTIVE REACTION TO STUDENT DEMONSTRATION JAN 7, 
ENCOURAGED MORE VIOLENT DEMONSTRATION WHICH NECESSITATED 
VIOLENT REPRESSION TO PUT DOWN. AT LEAST IT IS CONCEIVABLE 
THAT THE MANY PROPONENTS OF THE MAILED FIST IN GOI 
ESTABLISHMENT MIGHT SO ARGUE TO THE SHAH AND PRIMIN 
AMOUZEGAR IN EFFORT TO REVERSE RELATIVE LIBERALIZATION OF 
RECENT MONTHS.

E.O. 11652: GDS 
TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PINT, AF, US 
SUBJECT: FIRST CONVERSATION WITH NEW AFGHAN PRESIDENT 
 
1. MUR MOHAMHAD TARAKI, THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN\'S NEW 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND HE LIKES TO BE CALLED \"MR. PRESIDENT,\" 
RECEIVED ME ALONE IN HIS OFFICE AT THE OLD PRIME MINISTRY BUILDING 
AT 5 P.M. ON MAY 6, I WAS RECEIVED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING 
BY THE SAME CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF OF PROTOCOL WHO HAD SERVED THE 
PREVIOUS REGIME. AS AN INDICATION OF THE TIMES, THE DEPUTY CHIEF, 
WHO IS A MOHAMMADZAI, STARTED WEEPING WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS 
FAMILY. IT WAS IN THIS MOOD THAT HE USHERED ME INTO HIS NEW CHIEF\'S 
OFFICE. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS SEEMED TO BE MINIMAL, WITH ONLY ONE 
ARMORED VEHICLE VISIBLE IN THE COMPOUND OF THE PRIME MINISTRY. 
 
2. TABAKI GREETED ME WITH A WARM HANDSHAKE AND A FRIENDLY SMILE, 
DULY RECORDED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS. WE THEN SAT DOWN IN THE CORNER OF 
HIS OFFICE AND EXCHANGED A FEW PLEASANTRIES WHILE OUR PICTURES 
CONTINUED TO BE SNAPPED. I GOT A GOOD LAUGH FROM HIM WHEN I SAID I 
WAS SORRY I HAD NOT MET HIM DURING MY FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS IN 
AFGHANISTAN -- AND EVEN SORRIER DURING THE PAST NINE DAYS. TARAKI 
SPOKE EXCELLENT, IF SOMEWHAT RUSTY, ENGLISH. 
 
3. TARAKI BEGAN HIS CONVERSATION BY RECOUNTING WITH OBVIOUS PRIDE 
AND RELISH THE SUCCESS OF HIS REVOLUTION, STRESSING THAT IT IS A 
REVOLUTION AND NOT A COUP. HE SAID ON THURSDAY, APRIL 27, THE TANKS 
FIRST MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF KABUL ABOUT 9 A.M., BUT TOOK MORE 
THAN TWO HOURS TO REACH THE CENTER OF THE CITY. BY EVENING, THE 
DAOUD REGIME HAD LOST THE BATTLE, ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED IN VAIN 
DURING THE NIGHT TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS FROM CENTRAL CORPS 
HEADQUARTERS AND FROM KARGHA. WITH THE COMING OF DAYLIGHT, HE SAID, 
THE AIR FORCE WAS ABLE TO FINISH THE JOB. MEANWHILE, WITHIN THE 
PALACE DAOUD HAD BEEN ASKED TO SURRENDER, BUT REFUSED, SHOT AT HIS 
ATTACKERS, AS DID HIS WIFE AND FAMILY, AND WAS THEREFORE KILLED. 
THE INTENTION, SAID TARAKI, HAD BEEN TO TAKE HIM AS A CAPTIVE. 
TARAKI ADDED THAT DAOUD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN COURT-MARTIALED 
AND POSSIBLY SHOT. TARAKI HAD YESTERDAY  
THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN SHOT BY DAOUD\'S \"WHITE PISTOL\". 
 
4. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WAS SURPRISED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN THE FIRST 
AMBASSADOR TO CALL ON HIM, BECAUSE WHAT HE IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH 
IN AFGHANISTAN IS A \"GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR 
THE PEOPLE.\" CORRECTING HIMSELF A BIT, HE SAID HE HAD ASKED THE SAME 
QUESTION OF THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR BECAUSE PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN 
HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON, CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY. 
 
5. I THEN EXPLAINED THAT IN CASES LIKE THIS, WE DO NOT EXTEND FORMAL 
RECOGNITION BUT INDICATE, AS WE HAVE DONE, THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE 
NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. I SAID, IN FACT, WE HOPE TO HAVE CLOSE 
WORKING RELATIONS WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT. I ADDED, AS OUR NOTE 
STATED, THAT I HOPE HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE SOON TO 
AFFIRM THE VALIDITY OF EXISTING TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS. HE MAD NO 
COMMENT ON THAT SUGGESTION. 
 
6. AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THESE PRELIMINARY EXCHANGES, TARAKI 
REFERRED TO THE TIME HE HAD SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES, HIS 
FRIENDSHIP FOR AMERICANS, AND HIS LIKING FOR THE AMERICAN QUALITY OF 
FRANKNESS. WE AGREED THAT AFGHANS AND AMERICANS HAVE LOTS IN COMMON 
IN THIS REGARD. 
 
7. I THEN STATED I WANTED TO BE FRANK WITH HIM. I SAID THAT, AS HE 
KNEW, THE UNITED STATES HAD NEVER SOUGHT ANY STRATEGIC OR POLITICAL 
ADVANTAGE FROM AFGHANISTAN. HE AGREED. I SAID THAT ONE OF THE CARDINAL 
POINTS OF OUR POLICY IS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE, 
ITS INTEGRITY, AND ITS NATIONAL IDENTITY. HE NODDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. 
I SAID THAT SINCE THE BRITISH LEFT INDIA, IT WAS OUR VIEW THAT THE 
ONLY COUNTRY THAT COULD POSSIBLY THREATEN AFGHANISTAN\'S INDEPENDENCE 
IS THE SOVIET UNION. IN PAST TIMES, I NOTED, OUR POLICY HAD BEEN TO 
TRY TO CONSTRUCT BLOCS AGAINST SOVIET EXPANSIONISM, BUT THAT OUR 
APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM HAD, IN THE COURSE OF TIME BECOME MORE 
SOPHISTICATED. 
 
I STATED WE COULD READILY UNDERSTAND -- GIVEN AFGHANISTAN\'S 
GEOGRAPHIC POSITION AND ECONOMIC NEEDS -- WHY IT WOULD WANT A CLOSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION. BUT, I SAID, WE WOULD BE DISTURBED 
IF AFGHANISTAN\'S FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICIES WERE TO BECOME 
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE THAT WOULD 
OBLITERATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NATIONAL IDENTITY AND WOULD GIVE RISE TO 
TENSIONS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WHICH COULD THREATEN PEACE. I SAID 
THAT IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE APPRECIATE AFGHANISTAN\'S NONALIGNED 
POLICY. 
 
8. IN RESPONSE, TARAKI AFFIRMED THAT AFGHANISTAN IS AND DESIRES TO 
REMAIN AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY AND MASTER OF ITS OWN DESTINY. HE SAID HE 
WAS PLEASED THAT THE UNITED STATES TAKES A MORE FLEXIBLE VIEW OF THE 
WORLD AND ADMITS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IT MADE A MISTAKE IN VIETNAM. HE 
REFERRED TO HIS BEING IN WASHINGTON DURING THE DAYS OF SENATOR MCCARTHY, 
AND NOTED THAT THE THEN VICE PRESIDENT NIXON HAD REFUSED ONCE TO COME 
TO AN AFGHAN EMBASSY RECEPTION BECAUSE AFGHANISTAN WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE 
SOVIET UNION. HE WAS PLEASED THAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE APPROACH THE 
UNITED STATES TAKES TOWARD HIS COUNTRY. 
 
9. I THEN SAID THAT IN EVALUATING THE POLICIES OF A GOVERNMENT IN A 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE AFGHANISTAN, THE UNITED STATES WOULD LOOK FIRST 
AND FOREMOST AT WHAT THAT GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF 
LIVING OF ITS PEOPLE AND TO ASSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS -- 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND LEGAL. AT THIS POINT, TARAKI BECAME 
MUCH MORE ANIMATED AND HELD FORTH AT SOME LENGTH ON THE SUBJECT OF HOW 
HIS GOVERNMENT WANTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HE 
AND HIS COLLEAGUES -- UNLIKE HIS PREDECESSORS, REALLY CARE ABOUT THE 
POOR PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN PUTTING MONEY IN 
SWISS BANKS. HE SAID THAT IN JUDGING HIS GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES, WE 
SHOULD ASK THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN WHETHER THEY THINK THEY ARE 
SUCCESSFUL. IN THE PAST, HE BELIEVED FOREIGNERS TENDED TO ASK THE 
ARISTOCRATS WHO, OF COURSE, WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HELPING THE POOR 
BECAUSE SUCH A POLICY WOULD THREATEN THEIR OWN PROSPERITY. REGARDING 
HUMAN RIGHTS, TARAKI SAID THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM AND THAT 
EACH NATION MUST JUDGE FOR ITSELF THE KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE MOST 
SUITED TO ITS OWN SITUATION AND CULTURE. HE MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT 
HE WOULD NOT WANT US TO MAKE VALUE JUDGEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT 
TO INTERFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. I ASSURED HIM THAT 
THE UNITED STATES HAD NO DESIRE TO TRY TO TRANSPLANT ITS GOVERNMENTAL 
SYSTEM ELSEWHERE, BUT THAT WE, NEVERTHELESS, CARE DEEPLY ABOUT HUMAN 
RIGHTS. 
 
10. TARAKI THEN SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD JUDGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS BY 
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP AFGHANISTAN. HE SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT\'S 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMULATED, BUT THAT HE 
WOULD BE ASKING US FOR ASSISTANCE AS, INDEED, HE WOULD BE ASKING THE 
SOVIET UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES. HE SAID THAT THE PRINCIPAL SLOGAN, 
ADDING THAT HE REALLY MEANT POLICY AND NOT SLOGAN, OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS 
TO PROVIDE BREAD, CLOTHING, AND SHELTER FOR THE MASSES. I DESCRIBED OUR 
AID PROGRAM OF RECENT YEARS AND ITS EMPHASIS ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND 
AGRICULTURE FOR THE RURAL POOR. HE SAID HE WOULD TELL ME, AS HE HAD 
TOLD THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR, THAT OUR RESPECTIVE AID PFORAMS HAD FAILED, 
AND THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMITMENT OF THE PREVIOUS 
REGIME. I SAID I AGREED WITH HIM THAT OUR AID PROGRAM HAD NOT ACHIEVED 
ITS GOALS. HE ASKED ME WHY. I REPLIED THAT HE KNEW HIS OWN COUNTRY 
BETTER THAN I, AND THAT I WOULD MERELY SAY THAT THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT 
WAS NOT CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT WE WISHED TO 
SEE IMPLEMENTED. HE OBVIOUSLY TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN MY SAYING THIS. 
 
11. TARAKI THEN SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE 
MEANT BY \"BREAD\". HE SAID HE WANTS TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF 
AFGHANS WHO HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY TO WORK IN IGNOMINY ABROAD. THIS WILL 
MEAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND HE HOPED WE 
WOULD HELP WITH THAT. I TOLD HIM THAT ONCE THE APPROPRIATE MINISTERS IN 
HIS GOVERNMENT WERE PREPARED TO DISCUSS SUCH MATTERS WITH US, MY AID 
MISSION DIRECTOR AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO. 
 
12. I THEN SAID THAT ONE OTHER MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED 
STATES IS THE STABILITY OF THIS REGION IN THE WORLD. I SAID WE HAVE BEEN 
DELIGHTED AT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN 
DEVELOPING REGIONAL COOPERATION. TARAKI SAID THAT THAT WAS, OF COURSE, 
A MATTER THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE STUDYING. HE ALSO SAID THAT WHEN 
ONE TALKS OF REGIONAL COOPERATION, THAT MEANS NOT ONLY COOPERATION WITH 
INDIA, PAKISTAN, AND IRAN -- BUT ALSO WITH THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
13. THE CONVERSATION ENDED WITH PLEASANTRIES AS IT HAD BEGUN. HE SAID 
THAT HE HOPED THE SOVIET UNION WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE BUILT MORE 
MOSQUES. BY THE SAME TOKEN, HE HOPED WE WOULD NOT JUDGE HIM BADLY IF HE, 
HIMSELF, DID NOT GO TO A MOSQUE. HE CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT EVERYTHING 
HE HAD TOLD ME HE HAD ALSO TOLD THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
14. COMMENT:  TARAKI IS A SLIM, WHITE-HAIRED, PROFESSIONAL MAN WHO LOOKS 
SOMEWHAT OLDER THAN 61. HE HAS THE CHAN AND EMPATHY THAT ONE LEARNS TO 
ASSOCIATE WITH AFGHANS. HE IS ALSO CLEARLY HARDHEADED AND EXHILARATED BY 
HIS SUCCESS. WHEN HE IS PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT A POINT HE IS 
MAKING, HIS EYES ASSUME A FIERCE, INTENSITY. OUR CONVERSATION WAS 
EXTREMELY CORDIAL AND WAS ALSO, I THINK, A REAL DIALOGUE.

TAGS: PEPR, IR 
SUBJECT: NEGOTIATIONS 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. INTRODUCTION: RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH THE 
EMBASSY HAS BEEN INVOLVED HERE, RANGING FROM COMPOUND 
SECURITY TO VISA OPERATIONS TO GTE TO THE SHERRY CASE, 
HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL SPECIAL FEATURES OF CONDUCTING 
BUSINESS IN THE PERSIAN ENVIRONMENT. IN SOME INSTANCES 
THE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE A PARTIAL 
REFLECTION ON THE EFFECTS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION, 
BUT WE BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
QUALITIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES 
ARE AND WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT. THEREFORE, 
WE SUGGEST THAT THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS BE USED TO BRIEF 
BOTH USG PERSONNEL AND PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES 
WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND IN THIS 
COUNTRY. END INTRODUCTION. 
 
3. PERHAPS THE SINGLE DOMINANT ASPECT OF THE PERSIAN 
PSYCHE IS AN OVERRIDING EGOISM. ITS ANTECEDENTS LIE 
IN THE LONG IRANIAN HISTORY OF INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY 
WHICH PUT A PREMIUM ON SELF-PRESERVATION. THE PRACTICAL 
EFFECT OF IT IS AN ALMOST TOTAL PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION 
WITH SELF AND LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR UNDERSTANDING POINTS 
OF VIEW OTHER THAN ONE\'S OWN. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IT 
IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO AN IRANIAN THAT U.S. IMMIGRATION 
LAW MAY PROHIBIT ISSUING HIM A TOURIST VISA WHEN HE HAS 
DETERMINED THAT HE WANTS TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. 
SIMILARLY, THE IRANIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES NO INCONSISTENCY 
IN CLAIMING FORCE MAJEURE TO AVOID PENALTIES FOR LATE 
PAYMENT OF INTEREST DUE ON OUTSTANDING LOANS WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF WHICH IT IS A PART IS DENYING THE VAILIDITY 
OF THE VERY GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS MADE WHEN 
CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR CLAIMS FROM FOREIGN FIRMS FORCED 
TO CEASE OPERATIONS DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION. 
 
4. THE REVERSE OF THIS PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL COIN, 
AND HAVING THE SAME HISTORICAL ROOTS AS PERSIAN EGOISM, 
IS A PERVASIVE UNEASE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN 
WHICH ONE LIVES. THE PERSIAN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT 
NOTHING IS PERMANENT AND IT IS COMMONLY PERCEIVED THAT 
HOSTILE FORCES ABOUND. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT EACH 
INDIVIDUAL MUST BE CONSTANTLY ALERT FOR OPPORTUNITIES 
TO PROTECT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MALEVOLENT FORCES THAT 
WOULD OTHERWISE BE HIS UNDOING. HE IS OBVIOUSLY 
JUSTIFIED IN USING ALMOST ANY MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT 
SUCH OPPORTUNITIES. THIS APPROACH UNDERLIES THE SOCALLED 
\"BAZAAR MENTALITY\" SO COMMON AMONG PERSIANS, A 
MIND-SET THAT OFTEN IGNORES LONGER TERM INTERESTS IN 
FAVOR OF IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE ADVANTAGES AND COUNTENANCES 
PRACTICES THAT ARE REGARDED AS UNETHICAL BY OTHER 
NORMS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE SEEMINGLY SHORTSIGHTED AND 
HARASSING TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE PGOI IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH GTE. 
 
5. COUPLED WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IS A 
GENERAL INCOMPREHENSION OF CASUALITY. ISLAM, WITH ITS 
EMPHASIS ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD, APPEARS TO ACCOUNT 
AT LEAST IN MAJOR PART FOR THIS PHENOMENON. SOMEWHAT 
SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THOSE IRANIANS EDUCATED IN THE 
WESTERN STYLE AND PERHAPS WITH LONG EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE 
IRAN ITSELF FREQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY GRASPING THE 
INTER-RELATIONSHIP OF EVENTS. WITNESS A YAZDI RESISTING 
THE IDEA THAT IRANIAN BEHAVIOR HAS CONSEQUENCES ON THE 
PERCEPTION OF IRAN IN THE U.S. OR THAT THIS PERCEPTION 
IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO AMERICAN POLICIES REGARDING 
IRAN. THIS SAME QUALITY ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN PERSIAN 
AVERSION TO ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE\'S OWN 
ACTIONS. THE DEUS EX MACHINA IS ALWAYS AT WORK. 
 
6. THE PERSIAN PROCLIVITY FOR ASSUMING THAT TO SAY 
SOMETHING IS TO DO IT FURTHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. 
AGAIN, YAZDI CAN EXPRESS SURPRISE WHEN INFORMED THAT THE 
IRREGULAR SECURITY FORCES ASSIGNED TO THE EMBASSY REMAIN 
IN PLACE. \"BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE TOLD ME THEY 
WOULD GO BY MONDAY,\" HE SAYS. AN MFA OFFICIAL REPORTS 
THAT THE SHERRY CASE IS \"90 PERCENT SOLVED,\" BUT WHEN 
A CONSULAR OFFICER INVESTIGATES HE DISCOVERS THAT NOTHING 
HAS CHANGED. THERE IS NO RECOGNITION THAT INSTRUCTIONS 
MUST BE FOLLOWED UP, THAT COMMITMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED 
BY ACTION AND RESULTS. 
 
6. FINALLY, THERE ARE THE PERSIAN CONCEPTS OF INFLUENCE 
AND OBLIGATION. EVERYONE PAYS OBEISANCE TO THE FORMER 
AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY HONORED IN THE BREACH. 
PERSIANS ARE CONSUMED WITH DEVELOPING PARTI BAZI--THE 
INFLUENCE THAT WILL HELP GET THINGS DONE--WHILE FAVORS 
ARE ONLY GRUDGINGLY BESTOWED AND THEN JUST TO THE 
EXTENT THAT A TANGIBLE QUID PRO QUO IS IMMEDIATELY 
PRECEPTIBLE. FORGET ABOUT ASSISTANCE PROFERRED LAST 
YEAR OR EVEN LAST WEEK; WHAT CAN BE OFFERED TODAY? 
 
7. THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE 
WITH PERSIANS IN ALL THIS: 
 
- --FIRST, ONE SHOULD NEVER ASSUME THAT HIS SIDE OF 
THE ISSUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED, LET ALONE THAT IT WILL 
BE CONCEDED TO HAVE MERITS. PERSIAN PREOCCUPATION WITH 
SELF PRECLUDES THIS. A NEGOTIATOR MUST FORCE RECOGNITION 
OF HIS POSITION UPON HIS PERSIAN OPPOSITE NUMBER. 
 
- --SECOND, ONE SHOULD NOT EXPECT AN IRANIAN READILY 
TO PERCEIVE THE ADVANTAGES OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP 
BASED ON TRUST. HE WILL ASSUME THAT HIS OPPOSITE 
NUMBER IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERSARY. IN DEALING WITH 
HIM HE WILL ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS TO HIMSELF 
THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY OBTAINABLE. HE WILL BE PREPARED 
TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, INCLUDING 
RUNNING THE RISK OF SO ALIENATING WHOEVER HE IS DEALING 
WITH THAT FUTURE BUSINESS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, AT 
LEAST TO THE LATTER. 
 
- --THIRD, INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL ASPECTS 
OF AN ISSUE MUST BE PAINSTAKINGLY, FORECEFULLY AND 
REPEATEDLY DEVELOPED. LINKAGES WILL BE NEITHER READILY 
COMPREHENDED NOR ACCEPTED BY PERSIAN NEGOTIATORS. 
 
- --FOURTH, ONE SHOULD INSIST ON PERFORMANCE AS THE 
SINE QUA NON AT ESH STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS. STATEMENTS 
OF INTENTION COUNT FOR ALMOST NOTHING. 
 
- --FIFTH, CULTIVATION OF GOODWILL FOR GOODWILL\'S SAKE 
IS A WASTE OF EFFORT. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AT ALL 
TIMES SHOULD BE IMPRESSING UPON THE PERSIAN ACROSS THE 
TABLE THE MUTUALITY OF THE PROPOSED UNDERTAKINGS, HE 
MUST BE MADE TO KNOW THAT A QUID PRO QUO IS INVOLVED 
ON BOTH SIDES. 
 
- --FINALLY, ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE THREAT 
OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND NOT 
BE COWED BY THE POSSIBLITY. GIVEN THE PERSIAN 
NEGOTIATOR\'S CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, HE 
IS GOING TO RESIST THE VERY CONCEPT OF A RATIONAL 
(FROM THE WESTERN POINT OF VIEW) NEGOTIATING PROCESS.

SUBJ: (c) TURKISH VIEWS ON KURDISH TROUBLES IN IRAN 
 
1. (C) - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. THIS IS AN INFORMATION MESSAGE; NO ACTION REQUIRED. 
 
3. MFA DIRECTOR FOR MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA KOKSAL, HAS TOLD US THAT TURKS HAD HEARD IRANIANS WERE PLANNING TO LAUNCH NEW MILITARY ACTION AGAINST CONCENTRATION OF KURDISH REBELS IN AREA NEAR IRAQI BORDER.  WHILE FOR THE MOMENT SITUATION IN KURDISH AREA SEEMS CALM, REPORT SUGGESTED THAT TEST OF STRENGTH BETWEEN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND KURDISH OPPONENTS WAS LIMITED BUT THEY HAD THE IMPRESSION THE KURDS, DESPITE LACK OF POLITICAL UNITY AMONG THE VARIOUS GROUPS, HAD MANAGED TO AMASS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ARMS AND COULD POSE A CONSIDERABLE GUERRILLA THREAT TO THE IRANIAN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FORCES. 
 
4. THE POSSIBILITY OF ARMED ACTION NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER ALSO RAISED THE QUESTION OF IRAQI RESPONSE.  SO FAR THE GOT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT GAME IRAQ WAS PLAYING VIS-A-VIS IRAN.  ON THE ONE HAND INSTABILITY IN THE REGION WAS AS UNHELPFUL TO IRAQ AS IT WAS TO ANYONE ELSE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WERE SUFFICIENT POINTS OF FRICTION BETWEEN A REVOLUTIONARY IRAN AND IRAQ THAT THE LATTER MIGHT WELL WISH TO STRENGTHEN ANTI-KHOMEINI FORCES. 
 
5. REGARDING TIES BETWEEN IRANIAN KURDS AND OUTSIDE COUNTRIES, KOKSAL SAID THAT THERE WERE MANY REPORTS, BUT NOT MUCH HARD EVIDENCE, OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE IRANIAN KURDS.  HE ASSUMED THAT OUTSIDE POWERS NOTWITHSTANDING PREDICTABLE DENIALS WOULD FEEL STRONG URGE TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN KURDISH ACTIVITIES.  REGARDING LINKS BETWEEN TURKISH AND IRANIAN KURDS, KOKSAL EMPHASIZED THAT RECENT PRESS REPORTS THAT TURKISH KURDS WERE PROVIDING LARGE-SCALE ASSISTANCE WERE TOTAL JOURNALISTIC FABRICATIONS.  TO DATE, GOT DID NOT HAVE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS ANY SUBSTANTIAL LINKAGE ALTHOUGH, OBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE KURDS IN IRAN WOULD HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON ATTITUDES OF TURKISH KURDS. 
 
6. BECAUSE OF THIS, AS WELL AS IN THE INTEREST OF REGIONAL STABILITY, TURKEY\'S OVERRIDING CONCERN WAS THAT IRAN MAINTAIN ITS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND HAVE A STRONG AND EFFECTIVE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  FOR THIS REASON THE GOT HAD NOTED WITH INTEREST AND APPROVAL CHARGE LAINGEN\'S RECENT STATEMENT AFFIRMING US SUPPORT FOR IRAN\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY. 
 
7. COMMENT: WHILE NEW TO THE JOB, KOKSAL, FORMERLY WITH THE POLICY PLANNING STAF, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE OPEN THAN HIS PREDECESSORS IN DISCUSSING KURDISH QUESTION.

E.O. 12065: GES 9/17/95 (LIMBERT, JOHN) OR-P 
TAGS: PGOV, PINT, IR 
SUBJECT: PM BAZARGAN CRITICIZED 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS, PM MEHDI BAZARGAN 
HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF CRITICISMS FROM VARIOUS SIDES. HE HAS 
BEEN ACCUSED OF ANTI-CLERICALISM, OF INEFFECTIVENESS, AND OF 
GENERAL BUNGLING. BAZARGAN HAS ANSWERED THESE ATTACKS BY 
CLAIMING THAT THE SAME PERSONS WHO WERE CRITICIZING HIM ARE 
NOT ALLOWING HIS GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION. DEPSITE THESE 
ATTACKS, IT APPEARS THAT BAZARGAN STILL ENJOYS THE SUPPORT 
OF KHOMEINI AND WILL NOT BE REPLACED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) THE FIRST ATTACK ON BAZARGAN CAME FROM AYATOLLAH DR. 
MOHAMMAD BEHESHTI, VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS, 
MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN PARTY. IN AN 
INTERVIEW WITH PARS NEW AGENCY IN QOM ON SEPTEMBER 14, DR. 
BEHESHTI BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT AND PM BAZARGAN FOR FAILING 
TO IMPLEMENT A BILL ON THE FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
ACCORDING TO BEHESHTI, THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL TWO MONTHS 
BEFORE HAD APPROVED A BILL CALLING FOR THE FORMATION OF 
COUNCILS AT PROVINCE, CITY, DISTRICT, AND VILLAGE LEVELS. 
BEHESHTI SAID DR. BAZARGAN\'S GOVERNMENT FAILED TO IMPLEMENT 
THIS BILL, EITHER BECAUSE OF DELIBERATE PROCRASTINATION OR 
BECAUSE OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE WEAKNESS. (DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER BANI-ASSADI TOLD CHARGE SEPT 17 THAT BAZARGAN\'S 
OFFICE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING THE REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL\'S BILL, HAD SENT A LETTER TO THE COUNCIL TELLING 
THEM THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED WAS UNREALISTIC BUT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK OUT A FEASIBLE BILL ALONG THOSE LINES. 
 
3. (C) LATER THE SAME DAY, THE MONOTHEISM PARY (HEZB-E- 
TOWHIDI) ISSUED A SEVEN-POINT STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE 
BAZARGAN GOVERNMENT FOR NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE. LITTLE IS 
KNOWN ABOUT THE HEZB-E-TOWHIDI EXCEPT THAT IT IS AN ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL GROUPING WITH POSSIBLE TIES TO AYATOLLAH SADEQ 
ROWHANI. THE CRITICISMS DIRECTED AT BAZARGAN INCLUDED: 
 
-  (A) GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENCE TO CRITICISMS OF IRAN IN THE 
FOREIGN PRESS, BOTH WESTERN AND NON-ALIGNED. 
 
-  (B) SEEKING POPULARITY BY PLAYING WITH WORDS AND BY 
OPPOSING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. \"PERHAPS YOU 
HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE IRANIAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT IS LED BY 
THE CLERGY.\" 
 
-  (C) DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\'S BILL 
ON FORMATION OF LOCAL COUNCILS. 
 
-  (D) NEGLECTING TO FOLLOW AYATOLLAH ROWHANI\'S ADVICE ABOUT 
THE NECESSITY OF PURGING THE GOVERNMENT OF ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY 
ELEMENTS. 
 
4. (U) THESE ATTACKS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ATTACK ON 
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 BY REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND COUNCIL 
OF EXPERTS MEMBER ABU-AL-HASAN BANI-SADR. SPEAKING TO AN 
AUDIENCE IN YAZD, BANI-SADR ATTACKED BAZARGAN\'S ECONOMIC 
POLICIES AND ACCUSED HIM OF HINDERING THE WORK OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. BANI-SADR ALSO ACCUSED BAZARGAN OF: 
 
-  (A) REFUSING TO ACCEPT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. 
 
-  (B) BUNGLING IN KURDESTAN AND THEN TRYING TO CLAIM CREDIT 
FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION THERE. 
 
-  (C) OPPOSING THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKS, A FAVORITE 
PROGRAM OF BANI-SADR. 
 
-  (D) BURYING HIMSELF IN TRIVIA AND NOT ORGANIZING HIS WORK 
PROGRAM. 
 
5. (U) IN AN ATTACK APPEARING IN THE ENGLISH AND PERSIAN- 
LANGUAGE PRESS OF SEPTEMBER 16, TEHRAN REVOLUTIONARY 
PROSECUTOR AYATOLLAH AHMAD AZARI-QOMI CRITICIZED BAZARGAN 
FOR ALLEGEDLY ANTI-CLERICAL STATEMENTS IN THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
EULOGY FOR AYATOLLAH TALEGHANI AT TEHRAN UNIVERSITY ON 
SEPTEMBER 11. AZARI-QOMI (WHO ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION FOR 
HEALTH REASONS) SAID THAT BAZARGAN HAD SAID THAT TALEGHANI, 
UNLIKE THE MAJORITY OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS, WAS NOT OPPOSED TO 
THE MANIFESTATIONS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION. ACCUSING BAZARGAN 
 OF WEAKENING REVOLUTIONARY UNITY, AZARI-QOMI SAID, \"IT IS 
VERY STRANGE THAT A DISTINGUISHED FIGURE AS MR. BAZARGAN WOULD 
MAKE AN UNFAIR ACCUSATION AGAINST THE CLERGY. WAS IT NOT 
TALEGHANI\'S GOAL TO UNITE ALL GROUPS, THE FOREMOST OF WHICH 
WAS A COMMITTED AND ACTIVE CLERGY? HOW CAN HE (BAZARGAN) PRAISE 
TALEGHANI BY STIRRING UP THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE CLERGY AND BY 
CONDEMNING THIS PROGRESSIVE AND ACTIVE GROUP AS REACTIONARY?\" 
 
6. (C) LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS OF BAZARGAN\'S SPEECH DID NOT 
INCLUDE THE STATEMENTS WHICH OFFENDED AZARI-QOMI. EMBASSY WILL 
CHECK FULL TEXT OF SPEECH (WHEN AVAILABLE) TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY 
WHAT PRIME MINISTER SAID. 
 
7. ALTHOUGH THE PRESS HAS BEEN GIVING WIDE PUBLICITY TO THESE 
ATTACKS, BAZARGAN\'S REACTION HAS SO FAR BEEN LIMITED TO A 
STATEMENT AT AN ECONOMIC SEMINAR (REPORTED BY ETTELAAT OF 
SEPTEMBER 16) THAT THE SAME (UNNAMED PERSONS WHO WERE 
CRITICIZING HIS GOVERNMENT FOR ITS INEFFECTIVENESS WERE THE 
SAME ONES WHO WERE INTERFERING IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND 
PREVENTING HIS CABINET FROM OPERATING.) 
 
8. (C) THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME (NOR WILL IT BE THE LAST 
TIME) THAT BAZARGAN HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK FROM MEMBERS OF THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. 
ALTHOUGH THE ATTACKS COMING FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AND FROM 
VARIOUS PERSONALITIES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY PART OF ANY CONCERTED 
ANTI-BAZARGAN CAMPAIGN, THERE ARE ENOUGH COMMON THEMESE IN THE 
CRITICISMS TO INDICATE THE COMMON INTERESTS OF HIS OPPONENTS. 
THESE THEMES INCLUDE: 
 
-  (A) IGNORING THE ADVICE OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. 
 
-  (B) IGNORING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. 
 
-  (C) GENERAL INEFFECTIVENESS AND BUNGLING. 
 
9. (C) IT IS WORTH NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT NONE OF THESE ATTACKS 
MENTION AYYATOLLAH KHOMEINI BY NAME AND THAT NONE OF THE 
ATTACKERS NOTE ANY CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR HIM. IN PREVIOUS 
DISAGREEMENTS OF THIS KIND, BAZARGAN HAS HAD ENOUGH SUPPORT 
FROM THE IMAM TO OVERCOME CALLS FOR HIS DISMISSAL. IT IS LIKELY 
THAT AS LONG AS BAZARGAN CONTINUES TO HAVE KHOMEINI\'S SUPPORT 
(AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF HIS LOSING IT) HE WILL BE ABLE TO 
SURVIVE SUCH ATTACKS. BAZARGAN\'S SURVIVAL, HOWEVER, IS UNLIKELY 
TO MAKE HIS GOVERNMENT ANY MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THOSE 
WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OVER MOST OF HIS FUNCTIONS.

SUBJECT: SOVIET COMMENTS ON IRAN 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. AT DINNER RECENTLY SOVIET AMBASSADOR VINOGRADOV SPOKE CANDIDLY OF PGOI. HE HAS SEEN VIRTUALLY ALL KEY LEADERS. AS AMIR-ENTEZAM OBSERVED, \"IF YOU CLOSE ONE DOOR, HE COMES IN THE OTHER WITH A PROPOSAL OR SOME DEAL.\" 
 
3. VINOGRADOV HAS SEEN KHOMEINI FOUR TIMES. HE DESCRIBED THE AYATOLLAH AS A MAN OF GREAT RECTITUDE, A TEACHER DISINCLINED TO LISTEN AND LITTLE VERSED IN POLITICAL REALITIES DOMESTICALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY.  TALAGHANI, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, WAS MUCH MORE THE REALIST. VINOGRADOV THOUGHT SKHESHTI WAS THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND POLITICALLY SKILLFUL OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP. BANI SADR MERITED ONLY SCORN. 
 
4. THE SOVIETS THINK THE PGOI\'S MOST DANGEROUS PROBLEM IS THE KURDISH REVOLT, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE STAGNATED ECONOMY. VINOGRADOV FEELS THE IRANIANS ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THE KURDS WITH FORCE AND THE ECONOMY WITH DREAMY ISLAMIC THEORIES.  NEITHER WILL WORK.  ALTHOUGH THE KURDISH PROBLEM MAY EVENTUALLY BE SETTLED, THERE WAS A REAL PROSPECT OF SHORTAGES, UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHER SERIOUS ECONOMIC GRIEVANCES LEADING TO DISAFFECTION OF THE LOWER CLASSES FROM KHOMEINI.  IT HAS ALREADY STARTED, BUT THE PROCESS COULD CONTINUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS.  HE SUSPECTED THE IRAQIS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH IRAN\'S KURDS AND ARABS, BUT DISMISSED THE THOUGHT THAT THESE USSR MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCE IN BAGHDAD TO RESTRAIN THE IRAQIS.  \"THEY ARE JUST CRAZY PEOPLE.\"

TAGS: PINT, SHUM, PINR, IR 
SUBJECT: MODERATION:  DOES IT HAVE A CHANCE? 
 
1. (C - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2. SUMMARY:  THE MODERATE IRANIAN POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH 
WERE ACTIVE DURING THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND WHICH HAVE A 
LONG HISTORY OF OPPOSITION TO THE SHAH, HAVE BEEN PUSHED INTO 
THE BACKGROUND BY THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO FOLLOW A 
NARROW AND AUTHORITARIAN INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. WITHIN THE 
PAST FEW WEEKS, MODERATE GROUPS WHO FAVOR A MORE BALANCED 
SOCIETY RESEMBLING A WESTERN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY, HAVE BECOME 
MORE VOCAL. WHILE NOT DIRECTLY CRITICIZING AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI, 
THEY HAVE FOCUSED THEIR CRITICISM ON SOME OF THE OBVIOUS 
FAILURES OF THE PRESENT REGIME. THE POLITICAL POSITION OF 
THESE GROUPS IS STILL PRECARIOUS. IT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH 
A FEW SECULAR SPOKESMEN, SOME LIBERAL CLERICS, AND SOME SMALL 
NEWSPAPERS. ALTHOUGH STILL NOT A MAJOR FORCE ON THE IRANIAN 
POLITICAL SCENE, THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ORGANIZE 
THEMSELVES ENOUGH TO EXPRESS IDEAS CONTRARY TO THOSE OF THE 
RULING ESTABLISHMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE ROLE OF SECULAR AND CLERICAL MODERATES -- THE HEIRS IS 
STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE. SINCE THE REVOLUTION FIGURES SUCH AS 
MATIN-DAFTARI NAZIH, FORUHAR, SANJABI, AND BAZARGAN HIMSELF 
HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY KHOMEINI AND BY HIS ALLIES WHO SHARE 
HIS VISION OF A THEOCRATIC IRAN. NOT ALL OF THESE SUPPORTERS 
OF KHOMEINI ARE CLERICS; THEY INCLUDE THE \"SECULAR MULLAHS\" 
SUCH AS QOTEZADEH, YAZDI, CHAMRAN, TABATABA\'I AND OTHERS. THIS 
GROUP HAS DOMINATED THE GOVERNMENT, THE PRESS, THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS. IT HAS 
HARRASSED AND IGNORED ITS OPPONENTS. BARZARGAN REMAINS 
POWERLESS; MATIN-DAFTARI AND NAZIH ARE IN HIDING; FORUHAR IS 
IGNORED; AND SAXJABI QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST AND LEFT THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
4. ALTHOUGH THE POSITION OF THE MODERATE PARTIES IS STILL VERY 
FRAGILE, IN RECENT WEEKS THEY HAS SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF LIFE. 
ALTHOUGH THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ORGANS, INCLUDING THE NEWSPAPER 
AYANDEGAN AND THE POPULAR HUMOR MAGAZINE AHANGAR, WERE 
SUPPRESSED IN AUGUST, THEY HAVE BEGUN PUBLISHING SMALL PAPERS 
SUCH AS KHALO-E-MOSALMAN (FROM THE MUSLIME REPUBLICAN PEOPLES\' 
PARTY); JONBESH (PUBLISHED BY ALI ASGHAR HAJ SEYYID JAVADI), 
JFBHEH-YE-AZADI FROM THE IRAN PARTY AND AZADI FROM THE 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT. ALTHOUGH THE CIRCULATION OF THESE 
PAPERS IS LIMITED AND THEY CARRY MUCH LESS INFLUENCE THAN THE 
THREE MAJOR DAILIES (SAYHAN, ETTELAAT, AND BAMDAD) THEY DO 
OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON EVENT -- A 
COMMENTARY OFTEN AT VARIANCE WITH THE OFFICIAL VERSION. 
 
5. FOR THE PAST SIX WEEKS, THE MUSLIM REPUBLICAN PEOPLES PARTY 
(MPRP) HAS ORGANIZED FRIDAY AFTERNOON MEETINGS AT ITS TEHRAN 
HEADQUARTERS. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST MEETING ATTRACTED ONLY ABOUT 
100 PEOPLE, EMBASSY POLITICAL OFFICER AND POLITICAL ASSISTANT 
ATTENDED OCTOBER 19 MEETING AND FOUND AN OVERFLOW OF OVER 1500. 
THE CROWD WAS LARGELY MIDDLE-CLASS AND WELL-EDUCATED. THERE 
WERE MANY WOMEN, SOME VEILED, A FEW CLERICS. THE SPEAKERS 
INCLUDED AHMAD ALIZADRH, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE MPRP, 
AND KAHMATULLAH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I, LEADER OF THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
MOVEMENT AND EAST AZARBAIJAN DELEGATE TO THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS. ALTHOUGH THE AUDIENCE AND SPEAKERS HAD NO AFFECTION 
FOR THE OLD REGIME, THERE WERE FEW MENTIONS OF AYATOLLAH 
KHOMEINI, AND NO ANTI-AMERICAN STATEMENTS. 
 
6. THE SPEAKERS ELICITED THE GREATEST RESPONSE BY THEIR 
ATTACKS ON AKHUNDBAZI (CLERICAL MEDDLING), ON THE COUNCIL OF 
EXPERTS, AND ON ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A THEOCRATIC 
DICTATORSHIP THROUGH THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIM. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS 
FOUND THE CROWD\'S PULSE WHEN HE SAID, \"WE WANT THE ISLAM OF DR. 
SHAR\'IATI; WE DON\'T WANT THE ISLAM OF ........)\" AND LEFT THE 
END EMPTY FOR THE CROWD TO FILL IN. BOTH MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I 
AND ALIZADEH WERE CRITICAL OF THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH. THE LATTER 
SAID, \"THIS CLAUSE IS AN ACT OF TREASON AGAINST FUTURE 
GENERATIONS OF IRANIAN PEOPLE. WE HAD A REVOLUTION NOT TO 
PREPARE THE GROUND FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF DESPOTISM.\" sPEAKING 
PRIVATELY AFTER THE MEETING, MOQOADAM-MARAGHE\'I SAID THAT EVEN 
THE RELIGIOUS LEADERSHIP HAS NOW REALIZED THAT IT WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO SELL THE VELAYAT-E-FAQIH TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE IN ITS 
PRESENT FORM. \"THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS HAS DECIDED TO REOPEN 
DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. I HOPE THAT SOME KIND OF IMPROVEMENT WILL 
BE POSSIBLE.\" 
 
7. THE MODERATES, IN CRITICISING VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, HAVE FOUND 
SOME ALLIES AMONG CLERICS SUCH AS AYATOLLAHS NURI AND SHARI\'AT- 
MADARI WHO SHARE THE VIEW THAT SUCH AN INSTITUTION, IF NOT 
PROPERLY DEFINED, COULD LEAD TO A DICTATORSHIP. ONE OF THE MOST 
INTERESTING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THE ENTRANCE OF 
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI\'S SON, HOJJAT AL-ISLAM AHMAD KHOMEINI, INTO 
THE DEBATE ON THIS SUBJECT. IN THESE DEBATES, THE YOUNG 
KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN A POSITION WHICH HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE 
MODERATE VIEW THAT VELAYAT-E-FAQIH, AS DEFINED BY THE 
CONSTITUTION, CONTAINS SOME DANGEROUS AMBIGUITIES. EMBASSY WILL 
DISCUSS THIS QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL IN SEPARATE MESSAGE. 
 
8. IN PART, RECENT OUTSPOKENNESS OF THE MODERATES CAN BE 
ATTRIBUTED TO DISILLUSION WITH SOME ASPECTS OF THE REVOLUTION -- 
ESPECIALLY TRENDS TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN, CLERICAL RULE. THE 
MODERATES HAVE ALSO TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S OBVIOUS 
MISHANDLING OF CERTAIN ISSUES TO ATTRACT ALLIES BEYOND THE 
NORMALLY MINISCULE CONTITUENCY OF GROUPS SUCH AS THE RADICAL 
MOVEMENT, THE IRAN PARTY, AND TEH NATIONAL FRONT. FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE OBVIOUS FAILURE OF A MILITARY POLICY IN KURDESTAN HAS 
BROUGHT CALLS FOR RECONCILIATION, EVEN BY FIGURES WITHIN THE 
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS. A COLUMNIST IN THE NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE 
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEHRAN TIMES HAS URGED THE WITHDRAWAL OF NON- 
KURDISH GUARDS FROM THE REGION; THE TUDEH PARTY PAPER MARDOM, 
STUNG BY ACCUSATIONS OF SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN KURDESTAN, HAS 
CALLED FOR A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. ONLY THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMIC 
REPUBLICAN PARTY, THROUGH ITS ORGAN JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI, HAS 
CONTINUED TO REFER TO THE KURDISH INSURGENTS AS \"AMERICAN 
MERCENARIES\". HOWEVER, THE IRP HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ISOLATED 
IN ITS POSITION. 
 
9. THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAILURE TO ENSURE PERSONAL SECURITY, ITS 
CRUDE ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP, AND SCANDALS INVOLVING THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COURT SYSTEM -- LARGE-SCALE BRIBERY AND THEFT 
INVOLVING NO LESS A FIGURE THAN FORMER TEHRAN PROSECUTOR 
AYATOLLAH AZARI-QOMI HIMSELF -- HAS ALSO WIDENED THE APPEAL OF 
THE MODERATE MESSAGE. THE PAPER AZADI OF OCTOBER 18 PRINTED A 
BITTER ATTACK ON THE REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE SYSTEM ACCUSING IT 
OF IGNORING THEFTS BY ILYAVI, FORMER ASSISTANT TO PROSECUTOR- 
GENERAL HADAVI, WHILE SENDING PROSTITUTES AND SMALL-TIME DRUG 
SMUGGLERS TO THE FIRING SQUAD. THE RECENT ATTACK ON TWO 
JOURNALISTS AT THE COUNCIL OF EXPERTS BUILDING LED THE ULTRA- 
ESTABLISHMENT PAPER ETTELAAT OF OCTOBER 22 TO WRITE A STRONG 
FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL ENTITLED \"LET US NOT REPEAT MISTAKES\", 
POINTING OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF QOM AND TABRIZ REBELLED IN THE 
SHAH\'S TIME BECAUSE FOR DECADES THEY HAD BEEN DENIED THE RIGHT 
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 
 
10. WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS ADD UP TO? MOST IMPORTANT, THE 
MODERATES OF THE IRAN PARTY, THE NATIONAL FRONT, AND OTHER 
GROUPS ARE ONCE AGAIN FINDING THEIR VOICE AND BEGINNING TO SPEAK 
OUT. IN DOING SO, THEY WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME SEVERAL MAJOR 
OBSTACLES: 
 
-   A) THE MEDIA REMAIN FOR THE MOST PART IN THE HANDS OF THEIR 
OPPONENTS. JOMHURI-YE-ISLAMI BECOMES MORE RABID BY THE DAY, AND 
THE OTHER MAJOR PAPERS ARE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. THE RADIO AND THE 
TELEVISION, UNDER QOTEZADEH\'S OPPORTUNISTIC AND UNENLIGHTENED 
GUIDANCE, RARELY DEVIATES FROM ITS DAILY MENU OF PSEUDO- 
RELIGIOUS DRIVEL INTERSPERSED WITH PSEUDO-REVOLUTIONARY DRIVEL. 
 
-   B) ALL INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN TAINTED BY KHOMEINI\'S 
DENUNCIATIONS. HIS FAMOUS AUGUST DECLARATION THAT \"WE DO NOT WANT 
INTELLECTUALS\" IS STILL REMEMBERED. HIS DIATRIBES AGAINST WESTERN 
DECADENCE HAVE MADE ALL WESTERN MANIFESTATIONS, INCLUDING 
NICETIES, SUSPECT IN HIS FOLLOWERS\' EYES. 
 
11. THESE MODERATE GROUPS STILL LEAD A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE ON 
THE FRINGES OF IRANIAN POLITICAL LIFE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY 
ARE LEFT ALONE TO HOLD THEIR MEETINGS AND PUBLISH THEIR 
NEWSPAPERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT TO THE POLITICAL 
PROCESS. HOWEVER, IN HIS MOST RECENT SPEECHES, KHOMEINI HAS TAKEN 
NOTE OF THEM AND HAS CRITICIZED THEM HARSHLY FOR THEIR ATTACKS ON 
VELAYAT-E-FAQIH AND ON THE CLERGY. IN A SPEECH TO TEHRAN RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS ON OCTOBER 20, KHOMEINI REFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE MPRP 
MEETING, SAYING, \"RECENTLY, IN ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS, ONE OF THESE 
MISGUIDED ONES, WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ISLAM, SUGGESTED THAT THE 
COUNCIL OF EXPERTS SHOULD BE DISSOLVED. AND THE REST CHEERED... 
YOU, WHO DID NOT EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTING (FOR THE COUNCIL) 
HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THIS... IT WAS THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO GAVE 
YOU (OPPONENTS OF VELAYATI-E-FAQIH) THE FREEDOM TO SAY WHATEVER 
YOU WANT TO SAY. YOU WERE IN HIDING WHEN THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
WERE STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SHAH AND HIS FATHER. NOW YOU WANT TO 
DISSOLVE THE ASSEMBLY?... YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO. I 
WILL SLAP YOU IN THE MOUTH. STOP THIS AND JOIN THE RANKS OF ISLAM 
AND LET THIS COUNTRY PUT ITSELF IN ORDER.\" 
 
12. KHOMEINI\'S ATTACKS ON THIS GROUP ARE STILL ONLY WORDS AND ARE 
UNLIKELY TO TAKE THE FORM OF ALL-OUT REPRESSION INVOLVING THE 
CLOSING OF NEWSPAPERS, THE BANNING OF MEETINGS, AND THE ARREST OF 
LEADERSHIP. MANY OF THESE GROUPS AND THEIR LEADERS HAVE 
DISTINGUISHED RECORDS OF OPPOSITION TO THE MONARCHY - RECORDS WHICH 
ARE DIFFICULT TO IGNORE. HOWEVER, THE HARD-LINE CLERGY AND ITS 
ALLIES HAVE BEEN ISOLATING AND ATTACKING INDIVIDUAL TARGETS FROM 
AMONG THE MODERATES SUCH AS ??AZIH, METEN-DAFTARI, AND FORUHAR. 
 
13. AS THE AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO MISHANDLE MATTERS SUCH AS ARAB- 
IRANIAN RELATIONS, PROVINICIAL AFFAIRS, AND REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE, 
THE MESSAGE OF THESE MODERATE GROUPS COULD ATTRACT A WIDER 
FOLLOWING. PERHAPS THEY COULD FORCE SOME CONCESSION TO THOSE WHO 
DO NOT SHARE THE IMAM\'S VISION OF AN IRAN RULED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THE TEACHINGS OF THAT SPECIALIZED VIEW OF ISLAM HELD BY ONE SECTOR 
OF A MINORITY SECT OF THAT RELIGION. 
 
14. IN THE LONGER TERM, IF THESE GROUPS CAN PRESERVE SOME 
COHERENCE THEY MAY PRESENT AN ALTERNATIVE TO A CLERICAL MONOPOLY 
OF POWER IN POST-KHOMEINI IRAN. AT THAT TIME THEIR REVOLUTIONARY 
CREDENTIALS MAY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT; BUT FOR THE IMMEDIATE 
FUTURE, THIS GROUP WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE ON THE PERIPHERY OF 
IRANIAN POLITICS -- ARTICULATE, INTERESTING, BUT WIELDING LITTLE 
REAL POWER.

1.  (C) SUMMARY.  POST DELIVERS WHALE TALKING POINTS 
IN REFTEL TO GOJ OFFICIALS IN MOFA.  MOFA OFFICIALS 
QUESTION USG CALCULATION OF GOJ QUOTA UNDER \"PAST 
PRACTICES\" FORMULA.  GOJ HAS NOT MADE DECISION 
REGARDING ACTUAL NUMBER OF WHALES TO BE HARVESTED 
BY ANTARCTIC FLEET THIS SEASON, BUT GOJ AND USSR 
OFFICIALS HAVE EXCHANGED \"EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION\" 
NOT TO EXCEED LAST YEAR\'S HARVESTS.  TOTAL COASTAL 
SPERM WHALE CATCH AS OF JANUARY 7 IS 106 WHALES. 
END SUMMARY. 
- 
2.  (C) ON JANUARY 8, REGFISHATT MET WITH SUSUMU 
AKIYAMA AND KENRO IINO, DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
RESPECTIVELY OF THE FISHERY DIVISION OF THE ECONOMIC 
AFFAIRS BUREAU OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MOFA), 
AND DELIVERED A COPY OF THE FIVE TALKING POINTS 
GIVEN IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  BOTH INDICATED THE 
TALKING POINTS WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER WITHIN 
MOFA AND WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FISHERY AGENCY OF 
JAPAN (FAJ).  IINO NOTED IMMEDIATELY THAT FAJ 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CONSULTATIONS REGARDING THE WHALING ISSUE WITH USG 
OFFICIALS.  AKIYAMA STATED THAT \"NO DECISION HAS 
BEEN MADE\" IN GOJ REGARDING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF 
WHALES TO BE HARVESTED IN THE ANTARCTIC BY THE 
JAPANESE FLEET THIS SEASON.  HE MENTIONED THREE 
FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING AN \"APPROPRIATE\" 
HARVEST AS FOLLOWS: 
- 
(A) THE MOST RECENT HARVEST LEVELS SET BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) THAT HAD 
BEEN ACCEPTED BY GOJ (I.E., THE 1984 SEASON OVERALL 
QUOTA OF 3,027); 
- 
(B) CONSULTATIONS WITH CONCERNED COUNTRIES; AND 
- 
(C) THE FINDINGS OF THE IWC SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
AT THE 1984 IWC MEETING. 
- 
HE FURTHER MENTIONED HIS \"PERSONAL VIEW\" THAT THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OF THE CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE THOSE 
WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT GOJ WOULD OFFICIALLY 
RESPOND LATER TO THE U.S. BELIEF THAT \"THERE IS NO 
NEED FOR CONSULTATIONS.\"  AKIYAMA ALSO POINTED OUT 
THAT JAPAN HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING AN UNLIMITED 
NUMBER OF WHALES EVEN THOUGH THE FILING OF AN 
OBJECTION WITH THE IWC MEANS GOJ IS NOT BOUND TO 
ANY SPECIFIC QUOTA. 
- 
3.  (C) AKIYAMA SAID THAT GOJ AND THE SOVIET UNION 
HAVE EXCHANGED \"EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION\" TO CONDUCT 
THIS SEASON\'S WHALING FOR MINKE WHALES IN THE 
ANTARCTIC IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TOTAL CATCH WILL NOT 
EXCEED LAST SEASON\'S HARVEST LEVELS OF 3,027 WHALES 
FOR JAPAN AND 3,028 WHALES FOR THE SOVIET UNION. 
AKIYAMA NOTED THAT THE EXCHANGE OF INTENTIONS WITH 
THE SOVIET UNION CORRESPONDED TO THE ARRANGEMENT 
REACHED BETWEEN THE USSR, GOJ, AND BRAZIL 
REGARDING LAST SEASON\'S ANTARCTIC HARVEST, A 
COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE IWC SECRETARIAT. 
- 
4.  (C) SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE POSED REGARDING 
THE TALKING POINTS: 
- 
(A) IINO REFERRED TO THE LAST TALKING POINT, AND 
POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE ESTABLISHES A 1984/85 
HARVEST OF 342 WHALES FOR BRAZIL INSTEAD OF THE 
376 USED BY THE USG.  AKIYAMA THOUGHT THAT THE 376 
FIGURE PROBABLY INCLUDES THE TEN PERCENT IWC 
MARGIN OF ERROR THAT IS ALLOWED FOR WHALING IN 
AREA II, BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE 
OF THE USSR/GOJ/BRAZIL AGREEMENTS HAS  BEEN NOT 
TO PROVIDE FOR ANY MARGIN OF ERROR FOR THE 
HARVEST IN AREA II.  THUS, IN THE 1983/84 SEASON 
THE FIVE PERCENT MARGIN OF ERROR ALLOWED BY THE 
IWC FOR AREA II WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A BRAZILIAN 
HARVEST OF 630 MINKE WHALES, BUT THE GOJ/USSR/BRAZIL 
ARRANGEMENT LIMITED BRAZIL\'S HARVEST TO 600 WHALES. 
SIMILARLY, FOR THE 1984/85 SEASON, BRAZIL WILL 
HARVEST 342 WHALES IN AREA II, NOT 342 PLUS TEN PERCENT, 
OR 376 WHALES.  ACCORDINGLY, GOJ\'S QUOTA UNDER THE 
IWC GUIDELINES SHOULD BE 1,941 MINKE WHALES, NOT 
1,924. AKIYAMA AND IINO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THE 
USG REALIZED THAT A \"PAST PRACTICE\" CALUCATIONS 
WOULD ALLOW GOJ A HARVEST QUOTA OF 1,941 FOR THIS 
SEASON. 
 
(B) THE FISHERY DIVISION OFFICIALS ALSO ASKED FOR 
USG CLARIFICATION OF THE REFERENCE IN THE SECOND 
TALKING POINT TO THE NOVEMBER 13, 1984, LETTER OF THE 
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE REGARDING THE PHRASE \"IN 
EXCESS OF THE 1984/85 QUOTA FOR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE 
MINKE WHALES.\"  IN PARTICULAR, GOJ WANTS TO KNOW IF 
GOJ IS SAFE FROM THE THREAT OF CERTIFICATION UNDER 
THE PACKWOOD AMENDMENT TO THE MAGNUSON FISHERY 
CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT (MFCMA) IF GOJ 
HARVESTS FOR ANTARCTIC MINKE WHALES DO NOT EXCEED 
A CEILING OF 1,924 (OR 1,941) WHALES.  FURTHER 
ELABORATION ON THE SAME QUESTION WAS RAISED 
WITH THE COMMENT THAT USSR AND GOJ WHALERS BOTH 
OPERATE IN AREAS 4 AND 6 BUT ONLY GOJ OPERATIONS 
OCCUR IN AREA 5.  AS A RESULT, AKIYAMA AND IINO 
WONDERED IF THE TALKING POINTS WERE ONLY REFERRING TO 
AN OVERALL ANTARCTIC QUOTA FOR GOJ OF 
1,924 (OR 1,941) OR WHETHER THE QUOTA FOR EACH 
AREA WOULD BE EXAMINED IN ANY USG EVALUATION OF 
WHETHER MINKE CATCH LIMITS ARE BEING EXCEEDED THIS 
SEASON. 
- 
5.  (U) REGARDING REFTEL\'S PARA 5, AKIYAMA 
CONFIRMED THAT 106 SPERM WHALES, ALL MALES, 
HAD BEEN HARVESTED BY THE JAPANESE COASTAL 
WHALING FLEET THROUGH JANUARY 7.

         U.S. SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLICY 
 
1.  (U)  THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS (JANUARY 8, 
1985) CARRIED A LONG VERBOSE OVERVIEW OF 1984, THE \"ORWELLIAN\" 
YEAR (\"VIOLENCE AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE\") CREDITED TO DEREK 
INGRAM OF GEMINI NEWS SERVICE.  ONE PARAGRAPH MISREPRESENTS 
ONE FACET OF CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. 
 
2.  (U)  NINE PARAGRAPHS OF THE FULL-PATE ARTICLE DEAL WITH 
\"AFRICA\'S MOST DRAMATIC POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS\" IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA, AND TOUCH ON SOUTH AFRICA\'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES, 
ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND THE RENEWED ATTEMPT TO 
CREATE \"A BUFFERS REGION OF SUBDUED OR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORING 
STATES,\" BLACK UNIONS AND THE VIOLENCE IN SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN- 
SHIPS, AND BISHOP DESMOND TUTU\'S CONDEMNATION OF U.S. 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN POLICY.  THE OFFENDING PARAGRAPH 
READS QUOTE THE AMERICANS ARE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN MANY OF THESE 
MOVES IN A POLICY (OF) \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" AND ANOTHER 
PLANK OF THAT POLICY IS FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE 
NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, 
LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND.  THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN SWAZILAND, 
BUT THE OTHER TWO PROVED MORE STUBBORN.  BOTSWANA SAYS NO.  END QUOTE 
 
 
3.  (LOU)  DRAWING ON EXISTING GUIDANCE, EMBASSY PLANS 
TO SEND THE FOLLOWING LETTER OVER THE SIGNATURE OF THE PAO TO 
THE EDITOR OF THE BOTSWANA DAILY NEWS:  QUOTE: IN HIS \"VIOLENCE 
AND DISASTER, A GLEAM OF HOPE,\" WHICH APPEARED IN THE BOTSWANA 
DAILY NEWS OF JANUARY 8, 1985, MR. DEREK INGRAM WRITES THAT ON 
\"PLANK\" OF THE U.S. POLICY OF \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" IS 
\"FOR SOUTH AFRICA TO TRY TO MAKE NKOMATI-TYPE AGREEMENTS WITH 
OTHER NEIGHBORS, NOTABLY BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, AND SWAZILAND.\" 
THIS IS A MISSTATEMENT OF U.S. POLICY.  THE POLICY 
OF \"CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT\" INCLUDES AN EFFORT TO REDUCE 
CROSS-BORDER VIOLENCE BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS. 
IN THE CASE OF THE NKOMATI ACCORD BETWEEN MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH 
AFRICA, WE WELCOMED THE AGREEMENT AS A TURNING POINT AWAY 
FROM THE DESTABILIZING POLITICS OF CONFRONTATION IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA, IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH OF NEGOTIATIONS. 
FOR THOSE TWO COUNTRIES, A FORMAL POLITICAL AGREEMENT MET THE 
NEEDS OF BOTH PARTIES.  HOWEVER, AS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
STATE CHESTER CROCKER HAS SAID, \"THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS NOT 
PARTY TO ANY EFFORT TO IMPOSE A STANDARD FORMULA ON 
RELATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS NEIGHBORS.  EACH 
RELATIONSHIP IS DISTINCT AND STANDS ON ITS OWN MERITS. 
COEXISTENCE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS.  WHAT WE DO SUPPORT IS A REGIONAL 
CLIMATE OF DIALOGUE WHICH GIVES NEGOTIATON AND PEACEFUL 
CHANGE A CHANCE.\"  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THE RIGHT 
OF EACH OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S NEIGHBORS TO MAKE ITS OWN 
DECISION ABOUT THE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENTS IT WISHES TO MAKE WITH 
SOUTH AFRICA ON THE BASIS OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY 
AND STRICT RECIPROCITY.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES 
THAT NO COUNTRY SHOULD BE FORCED TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT WHICH 
IT VIEWS AS CONTRARY TO ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS.  END QUOTE

SUBJECT: ANGOLANS IN SADF SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF, 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES, SOUGHT REFUGEE STATUS IN BOTSWANA AND 
APPLIED FOR THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.  AFTER MEETING WITH 
EMBOFFS, THE MEN WERE SENT TO THE LOCAL UNHCR OFFICIALS TO 
REGISTER AS REFUGEES.  PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THEIR APPLI- 
CATIONS FOR REFUGEE STATUS ARE REPORTED SEPTEL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON JANUARY 4, TWO ANGOLAN MEMBERS OF THE SADF\'S 32ND- 
BATTALION \"BUFFALO COMPANY,\" CAME TO THE EMBASSY SEEKING REFUGEE 
STATUS AND INQUIRING ABOUT THE AMERICAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM 
(SEPTEL).  THE TWO FAMILIES TOTAL 15 PEOPLE. 
 
4.  THE MEN, JOAO FAUSTINO SALES AND LASERU NHUKWETE, CLAIMED 
THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAD FLED SOUTHERN ANGOLA IN THE 
DEBACLE OF 1976, SALES FROM SA DA BANDIERA (NOW LUBANGO) AND 
NHUKWETE FROM LUIMBALE (NEAR HUAMBO).  BOTH MEN SUPPORTED FNLA, 
SALES BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING FOOD AND GUNS FOR THE 
FNLA. 
 
5.  FROM 1976 TO 1978, THE FAMILIES REPORTEDLY LIVED IN AN 
ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP NEAR RUNDU ON THE ANGOLAN-NAMIBIAN BORDER; 
ANOTHER ANGOLAN REFUGEE CAMP WAS LOCATED FURTHER EAST IN THE 
CAPRIVI.  IN 1978, THE SOUTH AFRICANS GAVE THE REFUGEES TWO OPTIONS: 
THEY COULD JOIN THE SADF, OR BE RETURNED TO ANGOLA.  THE 
REFUGEE CAMPS WERE TO BE DESTROYED.  SALES AND NHUKWETE JOINED 
THE SADF AND ENDED UP AS TEACHERS FOR ANGOLAN CHILDREN OF OTHER 
RECRUITS.  SALES TAUGHT PORTUGUESE AND NHUKWETE SCIENCE.  SALES 
HELD RANK OF LANCE CORPORAL AND NHUKWETE CORPORAL. 
6.  ACCORDING TO SALES AND NHUKWETE, THE 32ND BATTALION IS 
COMPOSED COMPLETELY OF ANGOLANS, UNTIL 1978 ALL FNLA SUPPORTERS. 
SINCE THEN, A NUMBER OF UNITA SUPPORTERS AND \"APOLITICAL\" 
ANGOLANS HAVE ALSO JOINED THE 32ND.  WHILE THE ENLISTED MEN ARE 
BLACK ANGOLANS, THE OFFICERS ARE WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS, WHO ARE 
EORCED TO LEARN PORTUGESE IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE.  (SALES AND 
NHUKWETE SPOKE PASSABLE ENGLISH, BUT FELT MORE COMFORTABLE 
TALKING IN PORTUGUESE WITH THE EMBASSY\'S REFUGEE OFFICER.) 
 
7.  IN NOVEMBER 1983, THE MEN SAID THAT \"SOUTH AFRICAN 
INTELLIGENCE\" OFFICERS ENCOURAGED THE FOUNDING IN WINDHOEK OF A 
GROUP CALLED \"THE SOCIO-CULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF ANGOLANS IN 
SOUTH WEST AFRICA.\"  THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OR NATIONAL CHAIRMAN 
OF THE ORGANIZATION IS ALLEGEDLY TIMOTYO VICTOR, A UNITA 
SYMPATHIZER.  THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS INTRODUCED TO THE 
ANGOLANS AT RUNDU BY A COL. VILJOEN (WHOSE NICKNAME IS 
\"FANAKOLO,\" THE NAME GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE USED IN SOUTH AFRICAN 
MINES, SINCE VILJOEN ALLEGEDLY WORKED IN THE MINES BEFORE JOINING 
THE SADF).  THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUNDU BRANCH IS JOAO APOLINARIO 
WHILE NHUKWERE WAS VICE-PRESIDENT AND SALES SECRETARY. 
ACCORDING TO A COPY OF THE SPEECH GIVEN BY THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER (EMBASSY HAS ENGLISH COPY WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED TO 
AF/S), THE PURPOSE OF THE REORGANIZATION IS \"TO PROMOTE 
FRIENDLY CULTURAL TIES AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE ANGOLAN COMMUNITY 
IN SWA...TO MEET FELLOW SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS OF WINDHOEK, 
TSUMEB, KATIMA MULILO, AND RUNDU AT SOCCER MATCHES AND OTHER 
SPORTS EVENTS.\"  EVERYONE WHO IS A \"TRUE ANGOLAN\" WAS EN- 
COURAGED TO JOIN THE ORGANIZATION. 
 
8.  IN NOVEMBER 1984, AN EXECUTIVE MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION 
WAS HELD IN WINDHOEK AND ATTENDED BY ALL BRANCH LEADERS AND 
A LARGE NUMBER OF SADF OFFICERS OF COLONEL RANK OR HIGHER, 
ALL BELIEVED BY THE ANGOLANS TO BE FROM SADF INTELLIGENCE.  THE 
ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE \"FIRST PHASE\" OF THE PROGRAM HAD 
BEEN COMPLETED AND THEY COULD MOVE ON TO THE \"SECOND PHASE.\"  THE MEN 
RECEIVED A LECTURE ON THE DANGERS AND THREAT OF COMMUNISM 
IN THE AREA AND WERE TOLD THAT ELECTIONS WOULD SOON TAKE PLACE 
IN NAMIBIA; THE ELECTIONS WOULD BE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE INTERNAL 
PARTIES AND SWAPO.  THE TWO MEN FELT THAT THEIR ORGANIZATION 
WAS BEING POLITICIZED AND THEY WERE BEING PREPARED TO TAKE 
PART IN AN ANTI-SWAPO CAMPAIGN IN NAMIBIA.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
ANGOLANS WERE TOLD THAT THE SADF WOULD LEAVE SOUTHWEST AFRICA 
AND RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA; THE ANGOLANS IN THE SADF WOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO RETURN TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH THEM, BUT NOTHING WAS 
SAID ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THAT. 
 
9.  SALES AND NHUKWETE THEN REPORTEDLY DECIDED THAT THEY HAD A DIM 
FUTURE IN THE SADF AND DECIDED TO SEEK REFUGE IN BOTSWANA.  THEY 
OBTAINED TRAVEL DECUMENTS, TOOK OFFICIAL LEAVE FROM THE SADF, AND 
TRAVELLED THROUGH THE CAPRIVI TO KATIMA MULILO, CROSSED INTO 
ZAMBIA, AND THENCEOINTO BOTSWANA AT KAZUNGULA.  ACCORDING TO THE 
MEN, THEIR LEAVE EXPIRED ON JANUARY 7.

SUBJECT:  CHRISTIAN CHURCHES BOMBED IN TRIPOLI 
 
1.  (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS AGAINST 
CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS IN TRIPOLI DURING THE 
PERIOD JANUARY 8-9.  TWO CHURCHES, MARONITE AND 
GREEK ORTHODOX, WERE BOMBED ON TUESDAY, CAUSING 
SERIOUS DAMAGE, WHILE ANOTHER GREEK ORTHODOX 
CHURCH AND AN EVANGELICAL INSTITUTION WERE DAMAGED 
IN ATTACKS WEDNESDAY.  A CHRISTIAN CEMETARY WAS 
ALSO BOMBED WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
 
2.  (U)  ISLAMIC UNIFICATION MOVEMENT (TAWHIID) 
HAS ISSUED TWO CONSECUTIVE CONDEMNATIONS OF THE 
ATTACKS, NOTING THAT TRIPOLI HAS TRADITIONALLY 
BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF RELIGIOUS UNITY, AND DEPLORING 
EFFORTS \"TO FRIGHTEN THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF THE 
CITY.\"  WEEKLY MEETING OF ISLAMIC DAR AL-FATWA 
WEDNESDAY ALSO CONDEMNED THE BOMBINGS, AS DID 
BRIG. OTHMAN OTHMAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF 
INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES DURING A VISIT TO 
TRIPOLI WEDNESDAY. 
 
3.  (C)  CHRISTIAN NOTABLE AND LEBANESE FORCES 
CHARTER MEMBER, CHARLES MALIK, TOLD POLOFF THAT 
FOUR CHRISTIANS HAVE, AS WELL, BEEN MURDERED ON 
ROADS NEAR TRIPOLI, AND THAT CHRISTIAN RESIDENTS 
OF AREA FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES.  HE SAID THAT 
\"LEBANESE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY\" IS THINKING OF 
PREPARING A DEMARCHE TO STATE DEPARTMENT ON 
TRIPOLI VIOLENCE. 
 
4.  COMMENT (C):  AS ALWAYS IN BEIRUT, LIST OF 
POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS OF THESE ATTACKS IS A LONG 
ONE, BEGINNING WITH TAWHIID ITSELF.  MANY 
OBSERVERS ATTRIBUTE BOMBINGS, WHICH COME SOON 
AFTER RECENT DEPLOYMENT OF LAF INTO TRIPOLI 
AS PART OF NORTHERN SECURITY PLAN, AS EFFORT 
TO EMBARASS GOL (WHILE AT SAME TIME INTIMIDATING 
CHRISTIANS).  ELABORATING ON THIS HYPOTHESIS, 
CHRISTIAN LEBANESE EMBASSY EMPLOYEE FROM KOURA 
REGION HAS TOLD US THAT MUCH BLAME IS BEING LAID 
AT FEET OF STILL-ACTIVE COMMUNISTS IN TRIPOLI, 
WITH RATIONALE BEING THAT LATTER ARE TRYING TO 
DISRUPT SECURITY PLAN THERE AND PLACE THE BLAME 
ON TAWHIID \"PRINCE\" SHA\'BAN, WHO RECENTLY 
BOASTED IN A PUBLIC SPEECH THAT THE COMMUNISTS 
HAD BEEN CRUSHED IN TRIPOLI.  A SIMILAR ARGUMENT, 
HOWEVER, COULD BE MADE THAT TAWIID\'S MAIN RIVAL 
IN TRIPOLI, THE ARAB DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IS 
BEHIND BOMBINGS.

SUBJECT: CODEL SPECTER\'S MEETING WITH BINYAMIN NETANYAHU 
 
 
Classified By: CDA Luis Moreno. Reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.(C) Summary: Likud Party Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu told 
CODEL Specter December 24 that the United States could help 
Israel by \"neutralizing\" Iran\'s nuclear program.  Arguing 
that \"nobody in Israel believes Iran has stopped its nuclear 
program,\" Netanyahu said the first step is increasing 
economic pressure on the Iranian regime.  He suggested that 
US state pension funds divest from companies doing business 
with Iran and said it was important that the US not take the 
military option off the table.  Asked about the current 
situation in the Palestinian Territories, Netanyahu replied, 
\"Bring down the Hamas regime.\"  He said Israel should create 
an economic peace with President Abbas using concrete 
projects that give Palestinians hope in the West Bank and 
argued that Palestinian PM Salam Fayyad would be a partner in 
this endeavor. Former Israeli Ambassador to the US Zalman 
Shoval joined Netanyahu in the meeting. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Greater Economic Pressure Is the Way to Stop Iran 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.(C) Netanyahu told Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) and 
Representative Patrick Kennedy (D-RI) that Iran is still 
working to develop nuclear weapons and said the US should 
apply greater economic pressure on the regime in order to 
neutralize the Iranian nuclear program.  He noted that in the 
US, eight states have passed bills requiring state pension 
funds to divest from European and other companies doing 
business with Iran.  Netanyahu suggested Pennsylvania do the 
same, adding that intelligence reports show the measure is 
having an effect. He told the CODEL that Israel is passing a 
similar bill.  Senator Specter agreed with Netanyahu that 
despite the recent National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), Iran 
continues to develop its nuclear program.  In response to 
Specter\'s question about other measures the USG could take, 
Netanyahu advised checking whether divestment was possible 
for federal pensions.  He suggested that Congress examine the 
recipients of funding and other benefits to ensure the USG is 
not aiding companies doing business with Iran, particularly 
in the gas and oil industries.  Ambassador Shoval noted that 
the efforts of international banks and financial institutions 
to restrict their dealings with Iran were succeeding as well. 
 
---------------------------------- 
The International Community\'s Role 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Netanyahu dismissed the idea of letting the Russians 
enrich Iranian uranium and said IAEA inspections did not 
reveal the true state of Iran\'s nuclear program.  Calling the 
nuclearization of Iran \"the greatest danger to the world,\" 
Netanyahu said it was important to convince 4-5 major 
European countries to take stronger measures to prevent Iran 
from developing nuclear weapons.  He emphasized the 
importance of preventing not only investment in Iran but also 
the transfer of western technology to the Iranians.  Adding 
that it would be difficult to get the Russians on board in 
the wake of the NIE, Netanyahu said that the issue of Iran 
was not a \"political football\" in Israel, as compared with 
the US. He noted, however, that he does not believe the NIE 
reflects US policy on Iran. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Bring Down Hamas, Create Economic Projects in the West Bank 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4. (C) In response to a question from Senator Specter, 
Netanyahu replied that it was necessary to bring down Hamas, 
and that leaving Gaza in Hamas\' hands was like signing a 
death warrant for the Palestinians.  Netanyahu argued that 
any place Israel leaves will be taken over by Hamas or Iran. 
He advocated creating an economic peace with Palestinian 
President Mahmoud Abbas using concrete projects to show 
Palestinians tangible examples of success in the West Bank. 
This would contrast with the negative consequences of Hamas 
rule in Gaza.  Netanyahu said he believed it would be 
possible to have real economic projects underway within 
months, and that Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
would be a good partner for such efforts.  In response to 
Senator Specter\'s mention of congressional interest in 
conditioning aid to the Palestinians, Ambassador Shoval said 
there were rumors of a Fatah-Hamas coalition again.  He 
advocated making it clear to President Abbas and Prime 
Minister Fayyad that the US will not provide them with 
assistance if they join with Hamas. 
 
5. (U) CODEL Specter did not clear this cable.

FOR H - PLEASE PASS TO CODEL MARTINEZ 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: OREP, PREL, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN SCENESETTER FOR CODEL MARTINEZ 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  I warmly welcome Codel Martinez to Madrid. 
 When you arrive, Spain will be emerging from the Holidays 
and starting to focus on what is likely to be a very 
competitive March 9 general election.  Although the media 
here prefers to focus on the allegedly frosty U.S.-Spain 
relationship that followed Spain\'s 2004 withdrawal from Iraq, 
your visit is an important opportunity to emphasize that our 
two countries have overriding common interests in fighting 
terrorism and organized crime, strengthening NATO and the 
Transatlantic security relationship, and in promoting the 
spread of democracy.  End summary. 
 
Counter-Terrorism and Law Enforcement 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) U.S.-Spain relations were seriously damaged by 
President Zapateros\'s decision soon after his reelection in 
2004 to precipitously withdraw Spanish forces from Iraq. 
However, over the last several years both countries have made 
a concerted and successful effort to rebuild the relationship 
based on strong mutual interests in counter-terrorism, 
fighting narcotics trafficking and organized crime, and 
rapidly expanding economic ties.  The real bilateral story is 
found in novel initiatives such as the HSPD-6 agreement we 
signed in September to facilitate the sharing of information 
between our national counter-terrorism authorities.  Spain is 
home to a large and growing Muslim population.  The March 11, 
2004, train bombings were a shock to Spain (21 of the 
suspects were convicted here in October).  Spain remains a 
target of Islamic extremists; al-Qaeda has called for attacks 
to recapture the medieval \"Al Andalus\".  The Spanish are 
actively pursuing Islamic extremism terrorism-related 
investigations and have scores of suspects in jail.  Neither 
has the threat of ETA terror gone away:   two Spanish Civil 
Guard officers were murdered in France in early December by 
the Basque terrorist group. 
 
3. (SBU) Narcotics trafficking is another area of common 
concern.  Andean cocaine is a serious problem here, and 
Colombian trafficking organizations are active in Spain. 
Money laundering is another serious issue.  We are eager to 
find ways to increase bilateral cooperation and to encourage 
Spain to engage more aggressively with law enforcement 
authorities in key Latin American countries. 
 
Security and Diplomatic Cooperation 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Spanish military cooperation matters.  The bases of 
Rota and Moron are key hubs, midway between the U.S. and 
Afghanistan and Iraq.  U.S. planes and ships account for 
around 5,000 flights and 250 port calls a year in Spain.  The 
Spanish military is pro-U.S. and pro-NATO.  The navy employs 
the AEGIS system in its frigates and has been working for 
five years to acquire the Tomahawk missile system.  Spain is 
also interested in the Joint Strike Fighter.  We need to keep 
this military-to-military relationship strong. 
 
5. (SBU) Spain has 750 troops with ISAF in Afghanistan and a 
provincial reconstruction team in Badghis province.  They 
have contributed some 150 million Euros in Afghan 
reconstruction funds.  Planning is underway to allow the 
Spanish to train and equip an Afghan Army company, which we 
hope will be a prelude to the training and equipping of a 
full battalion.  On Iraq, Spain has contributed $22 million 
to the Basrah Children\'s Hospital and a further $28 million 
in development funding for Iraq.  Spain has nearly 1,100 
troops with UNIFIL in Lebanon and about 700 in Kosovo. 
 
6. (SBU) On the diplomatic front, Spain in recent years has 
more often been a follower than a leader, looking to stay 
within EU consensus on issues such as Kosovo, Iran, and 
missile defense.  It is more forward-leaning on the Middle 
East peace process, undoubtedly driven by FM Moratinos\' long 
personal involvement in the issue.  Moratinos was an eager 
participant in the Annapolis Conference and helped ensure 
Spain made a robust pledge of support for the Palestinian 
Authority during the recent Paris donors\' conference.  Driven 
by the twin threats of terrorism and illegal immigration, 
Spain is also increasing its engagement with the countries of 
North and Western Africa. 
 
7. (SBU) Spain is the second largest investor in Latin 
America (after Brazil) and wields significant influence 
there.  Spain wants strong democratic and free market 
institutions in the region.  Nevertheless, we have sharp 
differences over Cuba.  Spain\'s socialist government has 
opted for engagement, claiming it can encourage regime 
elements who want change.  We take every opportunity to 
remind the Spanish that the Cuban regime is only interested 
in survival and that the Cuban dissidents need and deserve 
the active and visible support of democracies everywhere.  On 
Venezuela, the socialists\' early efforts at constructive 
engagement with Chavez have gone sour.  At the most recent 
Iberoamerican Summit, King Juan Carlos publicly interrupted a 
Chavez tirade about former Spanish President Aznar, telling 
the Venezuelan President to \"shut up.\" The government is 
uncomfortably situated between Spanish companies who fear 
Chavez will move against their Venezuela interests and the 
strong public support for the King. 
 
Economy 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) Spain has one of the fastest growing economies in 
Europe.  In fact, the economy has grown in each of the last 
15 years, and per capita GDP passed Italy\'s in 2006.  In the 
last several years, a housing boom has contributed greatly to 
growth, but as elections approach, housing prices are 
stagnating, construction is slowing, and unemployment and 
inflation are staring to creep up.  U.S. investment has long 
been important to the economy (more so than bilateral trade), 
but the tables have turned.  This year, Spain has been the 
fourth largest foreign investor in the U.S., with particular 
emphasis in banking, construction, and renewable energy.  In 
the latter sector, Spain has the world\'s largest and third 
largest wind power firms, and Spanish firms also are active 
in U.S. solar and biofuels projects. 
 
Elections 
--------- 
 
9. (SBU) Spain will hold a general election March 9, and the 
campaign will just be heating up as you arrive.  The ruling 
Spanish Socialist Workers\' Party (PSOE) candidate is 
President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.  Despite a strong 
economy, a budget surplus, and a variety of social spending 
initiatives, the early polls indicate a close race. 
Nevertheless, the polls also suggest Partido Popular (PP) 
candidate Mariano Rajoy has had limited success getting his 
message out.  The PSOE will run on the economy and its social 
programs.  The PP will argue the economy is softening and 
that the PSOE has made too many concessions to Basque and 
Catalan regional governments, is weak on ETA, and soft on 
illegal immigration.  Foreign affairs is unlikely to be a key 
issue, but the PSOE will remind voters it got Spain out of 
Iraq while the PP will say Spain\'s international prestige has 
slipped. 
 
Conclusion 
---------- 
 
10. (SBU) Again, I am looking forward to your visit.  While 
we want to avoid being an issue in the Spanish elections, we 
do need to remind Spain that the bilateral relationship is 
founded on strong mutual interests such as counter-terrorism 
and law enforcement.  Regardless of who wins in March, 
terrorists, drug traffickers, and alien smugglers will 
continue to see both our countries as targets.  We have much 
work to do together.

SUBJECT: PROPOSED ISAF REORGANIZATION IN ZABUL PROMPTS 
OUTCRY BY PROVINCIAL LEADERSHIP 
 
REF: 1345 
 
Classified By: Interagency Provincial Affairs Deputy Director Hoyt Yee 
for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
1. (C/REL US, ISAF, NATO) Summary:  Recent planning by 
Regional Command-South (RC-South) to reorganize ISAF 
deployments in Zabul by withdrawing forces from districts not 
along Highway 1 prompted an outcry by Zabul\'s political and 
security leadership.  In response, Provincial and district 
leaders kicked off a week-long campaign challenging the 
RC-South approach, including threatening to pull GIRoA 
security and government officials from the districts beyond 
Highway 1.  The engagement with RC-South by Zabul\'s 
leadership prompted ISAF to revise its planning and keep ISAF 
units in all the districts in which they are currently 
active, thereby allaying the concerns of provincial 
officials.  By uniting in common cause and advocating 
effectively, Zabul government leaders demonstrated a 
political proficiency and efficacy heretofore unseen ) with 
notably more success at lobbying international forces than 
their own government.  End Summary. 
 
Proposed Task Force Zabul Reorganization Prompts Response 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (C/REL US, ISAF, NATO) As ISAF plans its revised troop 
presence for the coming year in the South, to include 
refocusing the Stryker Brigade\'s activities on freedom of 
movement along key highways, the configuration of Task Force 
Zabul has yet to be finalized.  RC-South\'s initial proposed 
changes included withdrawing ISAF forces from the western 
region, and from Nawbahar, Shamulzay, Atghar and Shinkay 
districts, resulting in TFZ focus in Qalat and Shajoy cities. 
 This would have been a fairly dramatic change of security 
posture in these districts where the last months have seen 
improved security as a result of the partnering of the 
Stryker Brigade and local ANSF in the districts.  The 
proposed changes prompted a quick and unified response by 
Zabul\'s security leadership.  Political and security leaders 
called together a special security session to review the ISAF 
decision to reallocate forces, and threatened to withdraw 
ANSF and local government representatives in the districts 
scheduled to lose ISAF troops.  By December 12, in response 
to the concerns raised, a Zabuli Decision Memorandum, drafted 
by the Security Committee, was being discussed at ISAF and 
RC-South Headquarters. 
 
Governor Naseri Returns from Kabul to Take Up the Cause 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3. (C/REL US, ISAF, NATO) The Governor of Zabul, who had been 
in Kabul for almost a month, returned to Zabul on December 14 
to take up the cause of his security committee.  Although 
allegations of corruption (Reftel) and rumors of poor health 
have plagued Governor Naseri, he reacted strongly, possibly 
energized by the challenges of ISAF reorganization at Task 
Force Zabul and by the unity of his advisors and government 
colleagues.  Via his two cell phones, he had been in constant 
communication with the provincial and district leadership 
during the security committee\'s deliberations and he had 
already engaged senior national government leadership on the 
issue. 
 
Naseri Says Decision Will Bring Retribution and Loss of Trust 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (C/REL US, ISAF, NATO) At a December 15 meeting, Governor 
Naseri met with the commanders and civilians from TFZ and the 
PRT to discuss the ISAF reallocation of forces in the 
province.  In an organized, composed manner, the Governor 
listed the following issues: 
 
-- It will be difficult to regain control of districts once 
they have been left to the Taliban.  Reprisals will occur and 
security gains of the last four months will be lost.  We will 
not be able to regain the trust of the people. 
 
-- Out of fear about enemy retribution and intimidation, 
Zabul citizens are \'displacing\' from the remote or threatened 
districts to Qalat city.  There are not sufficient government 
resources to provide for them. 
 
-- There are insufficient ANA forces in Zabul to compensate 
for the absence of ISAF.  The 1st Kandak is being moved.  The 
6th Kandak, committed to Zabul, never arrived and was 
diverted to Helmand.  There is an acute sense that ANA and 
Zabul are being short-changed and left vulnerable. 
 
KABUL 00004181  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
-- District governors are very worried about their safety; 
furthermore they were not consulted about the security 
conditions in the province or about the change in ISAF 
forces. They are displeased that RC-South leadership has not 
responded to their decision memorandum nor agreed to a shura 
to discuss and gain some consensus in for the ISAF plan. 
 
-- The Pakistan border will provide easy access and movement 
for the Taliban without a substantial ANSF/ISAF presence. 
Zabul will again revert to a safe haven for insurgents and 
enemy forces. 
 
-- Road projects and reconstruction will be abandoned due to 
lack of security. 
 
-- The Taliban will declare victory over the U.S. and their 
propaganda will be impossible to refute. 
 
-- The ANA and ANP cannot stay in Zabul without medevac, 
artillery, aviation and logistical support from ISAF. 
 
6. (C/REL US, ISAF, NATO) The TFZ Commander explained that 
ISAF leadership had to prioritize the use of military forces 
and that Helmand and Kandahar have more Taliban.  While 
restating his displeasure about the ISAF decisions, the 
Governor acknowledged that these places were most important, 
but he emphasized that this did not make it any easier to 
explain to the people of Zabul.  He confirmed that he and his 
ANA, ANP, NDS leadership team would continue to press their 
case with President Karzai and with RC-South. 
 
Regional Command South Leadership Comes to Zabul 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C/REL US, ISAF, NATO) To allay concerns and answer the 
call for discussion, senior RC-South leadership, including 
its commander MG Nick Carter (UK), visited Zabul on December 
16 to meet with Governor Naseri and his security team, 
including MG Jama Ludin.  At the meeting, they secured a 
commitment from ISAF to review the proposed force 
restructuring in Zabul.  After further internal deliveration, 
RC-South subsequently revised its planning to keep ISAF units 
in all the districts in which they are currently active, 
although at reduced levels.  The news came as a relief to 
provincial officials, including the Governor, who had 
confidently stated to others that \"Zabul would not be 
abandoned by ISAF.\" 
 
Comment 
------ 
 
8. (C/REL US, ISAF, NATO) The engagement by the Zabul 
Security Committee was the first time it has demonstrated a 
collective ability to organize and advocate on behalf of its 
citizens\' well-being.  With its decision to reorganize TFZ, 
ISAF indirectly accomplished what many other international 
and nongovernmental organizations had tried but failed to do: 
unite the leadership of Zabul to successfully address a 
common problem.  That said, they have so far only used this 
new skill to lobby the international community, not their own 
government. The PRT will continue to monitor the 
reorganization of the TFZ and its impact on governance and 
development.  While the key focus of our efforts in Zabul 
remains along the economic zone on Highway 1, the decision to 
leave troops in the outlying districts will enable Coalition 
Forces and the PRT to continue to have direct, if more 
limited, impact on governance and development across the 
province. 
9. (U) This message was drafted by PRT Zabul and coordinated 
with RC-South.

SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA ECONOMIC NEWS WEEKLY NEWSLETTER DECEMBER 28, 
2007 ISSUE 
 
1. (U) Summary.  This is Volume 7, issue 52 of U.S. Embassy 
Pretoria\'s South Africa Economic News weekly newsletter. 
 
Topics of this week\'s newsletter are: 
- Zuma to Review Inflation Targeting 
- JSE Rocky for New Mine Listings 
- PPI Slows to 9.1 Percent 
- Trade Deficit Surprise Fall 
 
End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Zuma to Review Inflation Targeting 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Jacob Zuma, the newly elected President of the African 
National Congress (ANC), said that he would look into inflation 
targeting, the current monetary policy used by the South African 
Reserve Bank to control inflation.  \"Clearly, our main method of 
inflation targeting, which is hiking the interest rate, has resulted 
in complaints from both the top end of the financial spectrum as 
well as the bottom end,\" Zuma reportedly said.  \"So it stands to 
reason that there\'s some kind of problem there.  And though I am not 
going to pretend that I have delved into the issue properly, it is 
something that I am going to get to,\" he said.  The Reserve Bank has 
raised interest rates eight times since June 2006.  In his first 
speech following his election, Zuma moved to calm fears that there 
would be a shift in economic policies.  (Mail and Guardian, December 
24, 2007) 
 
---=--------------------------- 
JSE Rocky for New Mine Listings 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) New mining listings had a rocky ride on the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange in 2007, with most of the newcomers trading in 
mid-December below both debut prices and mid-year peaks.  Seven 
resources companies joined the JSE this year, according to JSE 
business development manager Lauren Czepek, with another two or 
three in the pipeline for 2008.  The JSE is also seeing a lot of 
interest from foreign-listed mining companies seeking dual listings 
because they had South African assets and resources, or else needed 
to raise capital in South Africa or enter black empowerment 
transactions, Czepek said.  (Business Day, December 27, 2007) 
 
------------------------ 
PPI Slows to 9.1 Percent 
------------------------ 
 
4. (U) South Africa\'s producer price inflation (PPI) slowed to 9.1% 
year-on-year in November.  This fell below forecasts, and was lower 
than the 9.5% rise in October.  On a monthly basis, PPI rose by .3% 
after a 1.1% jump in October.  RMB economist Kay Muller said the 
figure was good news as \"it shows that inflationary pressures are 
showing signs of easing, and endorses our view that interest rates 
will be left on hold in January.\"  However, Investec Group economist 
Annabel Bishop said that, while the figure was lower than expected, 
there is a \"growing risk\" of further interest rate hikes as CPIX 
inflation is likely to peak at close to 9% early next year. 
(Business Day, December 20, 2007) 
 
--------------------------- 
Trade Deficit Surprise Fall 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The trade balance narrowed significantly in November to R608 
million ($87 million), the smallest gap since December 2006, 
compared with October\'s record R14.73 billion ($2.1 billion) 
shortfall.  Contributing to the deficit was a month-on-month 
decrease in imports of mineral products, machinery and original 
equipment components, and a month-on-month increase in exports of 
Qequipment components, and a month-on-month increase in exports of 
precious stones and metals and mineral products.  The cumulative 
trade deficit for the first 11 months of 2007 was R71.3 billion 
($10.2 billion), in comparison to R67.5 billion ($9.6 billion) for 
the same period last year.  This narrower-than-expected deficit will 
take some pressure off the rand and interest rates, with decreasing 
concern about the current account deficit for the fourth quarter. 
However, the current account deficit remains large, and will be 
around 6.5% of GDP in 2007.  (Business Day, December 28, 2007)

SUBJECT: IMMINENT PUBLICATION OF TENDERS FOR 692 NEW 
ISRAELI HOUSING UNITS IN EAST JERUSALEM 
 
REF: A. JERUSALEM 2063 
     B. JERUSALEM 2273 
 
Classified By: Consul General Daniel Rubinstein 
for reasons 1.4 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  On December 27, Israel press sources 
reported the impending publication of 692 construction 
tenders for new residential units in three Israeli 
neighborhoods of East Jerusalem: 377 units in Neve Yaakov, 
198 in Pisgat Zeev, and 117 in Har Homa.  While the details 
of the tenders are not yet publicly available, NGO contacts 
assessed that construction of the approved units would expand 
the current geographic footprint of Israeli neighborhoods in 
East Jerusalem.  Palestinian officials criticized the GOI 
announcement, arguing that it represented an intensification 
of settlement construction, an Israeli violation of the terms 
of the Roadmap, and a setback to the resumption of 
negotiations.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  On December 27, Israeli media announced the GOI\'s 
impending publication of 692 construction tenders for new 
residential units in three Israeli neighborhoods of East 
Jerusalem over the \"Green Line:\" 377 units in Neve Yaakov, 
198 in Pisgat Zeev, and 117 in Har Homa.  The tenders will be 
the first to be issued for East Jerusalem settlements since 
the Netanyahu government assumed power in March 2009.  The 
announcement was widely criticized by Palestinian officials. 
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Chief Negotiator 
Saeb Erekat argued to the Consul General and to media that 
the GOI move indicated a intensification of settlement 
activity, and called on the USG to push Israel to re-commit 
to the terms of the Roadmap.  Nabil Abu Rudenieh, spokesman 
for Palestinian Authority (PA) President Abu Mazen, termed 
the tenders \"illegal\" and \"a test of the seriousness of the 
Israeli government.\" 
 
3.  (C)  Background: This is the second prominent GOI 
announcement to take place in 2009 regarding East Jerusalem 
settlement expansion.  In November 2009, the Jerusalem 
District Planning Board approved the construction of \"Mordot 
Gilo,\" a complex of 844 new units to be built in an 
undeveloped forested site adjacent to the current East 
Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo (Ref A).  The Mordot Gilo 
planning scheme is now in a public review phase, and must be 
re-assessed by planning officials before construction tenders 
are published.  Publication of tenders is considered the 
penultimate step in the permitting process, followed by the 
assessment of contractor bids and the awarding of tenders to 
those contractors whose bids are successful.  End Background. 
 
4.  (C)  NGO contacts told Post it was impossible to assess 
just how much the construction of 692 new units would expand 
the existing geographic footprints of Neve Yaakov, Pisgat 
Zeev, and Har Homa, given that the Ministry of Construction 
and Housing has not yet made the details of the tenders 
public (the tenders are expected to be formally published and 
made available to the public in the next few days).  Several 
NGO officials noted, however, that it would be unrealistic to 
expect that 692 units could be built in these areas without 
expanding their physical presence.  Lawyer and activist Danny 
Seideman dismissed the notion that 117 new apartment units 
could be built in Har Homa without expanding the current 
settlement footprint, noting the present density of 
construction in the neighborhood. 
 
5.  (C)  Elad Halevy, Deputy Political Advisor to Jerusalem 
Mayor Nir Barkat, told Post that the GOI-issued tenders for 
new housing units in East Jerusalem dovetailed with Barkat\'s 
strategic vision for the city, arguing, \"this supports our 
aim to create affordable housing in Jerusalem.\"  According to 
Halevy, private developers selected by the Israeli Ministry 
of Construction and Housing during the bidding process that 
follows publication of the tenders will need to submit 
detailed building plans to the Jerusalem Municipality for 
approval.  He noted, however, that most such plans are 
approved, assuming they fall within the original parameters 
of the tender.  Halevy estimated that following the GOI 
selection of successful bidders, the municipal approval 
process -- which precedes construction -- would take several 
months. 
 
6.  (C)  Israeli media quoted Israeli Minister of 
Construction and Housing Ariel Atias as pointing to the 
recent \"authorization\" of 500 new housing units in the Arab 
East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan as evidence that the 
GOI employed an even-handed approach to East Jerusalem 
housing construction.  NGO contacts assessed that Atias 
referred to Barkat\'s December 14 announcement that he 
 
JERUSALEM 00002323  002 OF 002 
 
 
intended to pursue the re-zoning of Silwan in order to raise 
the height limit of Silwan buildings from two stories to four 
-- a plan that Barkat suggested in a press release would 
retroactively legalize up to 500 illegally-built Arab homes, 
and allow the construction of 500 more.  Note:  Barkat 
critics allege that the plan is in fact a political maneuver 
intended to prevent the court-ordered evacuation of the 
controversial Beit Yehonatan building in East Jerusalem, 
named in honor of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.  End Note. 
 
7.  (C)  NGO contacts were dismissive of Barkat\'s initiative, 
which requires additional review at the district level.  Ir 
Amim\'s Haim Erlich told Post, \"the Mayor likes to make 
announcements, but in most cases there is no plan with a plan 
number, budget, and allocated land.\"  Rami Nasrallah of the 
International Peace and Cooperation Center asked, \"even if 
the municipality permitted the development of 500 new housing 
units in Silwan (a crowded, poor urban neighborhood of about 
45,000), where would they go? There\'s no more room left in 
Silwan.\"

SUBJECT: INDIAN REACTION TO BHUTTO ASSASSINATION: UNIVERSAL 
CONDEMNATION, AND WORRY OVER CONTROL OF PAK-BASED TERRORISTS 
 
REF: NEW DELHI 5421 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Ted Osius for Reasons 1.4 (B, D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Indian officials reacted quickly to news of 
the assassination of Benazir Bhutto with statements 
condemning the heinous crime, sympathy for the victims of the 
attack, and a call for the continuation of the democratic 
transition, while commentators voiced concern over the 
Pakistani government\'s ability to control anti-India 
terrorists based on Pakistani soil.  Indian forces have 
stepped up security along the India-Pakistan border in an 
attempt to stop any terrorists trying to take advantage of 
any possible instability to infiltrate.  FM Mukherjee will 
travel to Pakistan on December 29 to head India\'s official 
delegation to Bhutto\'s memorial ceremonies.  The USA received 
criticism in the media and from contacts for its \"nave\" 
Pakistan policy. A large number of Embassy contacts believe 
President Musharraf had a hand in the assassination, despite 
the Al Qaeda claims of responsibility.  For India, further 
instability in Pakistan is deeply worrisome, because any 
loosening of the leash on Pakistan-based terrorist groups -- 
whether due to a backlash, or on purpose, or because the GOP 
is distracted -- could mean many hundreds more civilian 
deaths all across India.  End Summary. 
 
Indian Leaders Condemn Attack 
----- 
 
2.  (C) Indian leaders across the spectrum were quick to 
condemn the attack and offer condolences to victims.  Prime 
Minister Singh, traveling in Goa, described the assassination 
as \"heinous,\" noted Bhutto\'s contributions to \"break 
India-Pakistan relations out of the sterile patterns of the 
past,\" and said the manner in which she was killed is a 
reminder of the danger terrorism poses to the region.  The 
Prime Minister later visited the Pakistani High Commission 
personally to sign the condolence book.  President Patil, 
Congress Party leader Sonia Ghandi, BJP leaders LK Advani and 
Atal Behari Vajpayee, Foreign Minister Mukherjee, the 
Politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Hurriyat 
Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, the Jammu and 
Kashmir Liberation Front, and other prominent GOI officials 
all offered statements expressing shock, sadness, and a 
desire for Pakistan\'s transition to democracy to continue. 
The outpouring by the GOI was noted by Pakistani Deputy High 
Commissioner Afrasiab while A/DCM signed the condolence book 
on December 28, and First Secretary Janbaz Khan remarked that 
the Indian government had been quite supportive since news of 
the attack broke. 
 
Little Worry Of Street Violence In India In Short Term, But 
Concern Over Terrorists 
----- 
 
3. (C) Ministry of External Affairs Deputy Secretary 
(Pakistan) G Balasubramanian confirmed that the GOI is 
closely monitoring the situation on the street in Pakistani 
cities, however, there have been no reports of any particular 
incidents in India. Nor does Post expect any, as the 
assassination is generally seen here as having been free of 
any communal or sectarian overtones.  (Note: The Embassy\'s 
Emergency Action Committee meeting\'s assessment is reported 
in reftel.  End Note.)  Srinagar, the summer capital of 
Jammu-Kashmir, has completely shut down following a call for 
a protest strike by separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, 
according to press.  Balasubramanian told Poloff the GOI has 
tightened security along the Line of Control and 
international border with Pakistan in the expectation 
that a backlash against terrorist groups in Pakistan could 
lead them to seek refuge across the Indian border.  Indian 
police are stepping up precautionary measures and Emboffs saw 
around 50 extra New Delhi police officers stationed outside 
the Pakistani High Commission. 
 
4. (C) Several Embassy contacts expressed the view that the 
danger to India is not in the immediate aftermath of this 
incident, but in the weeks and months ahead if the Pakistan 
government is unable to control armed extremists from 
 
NEW DELHI 00005422  002 OF 003 
 
 
pursuing their \"death by a thousand cuts\" strategy against 
India.  Qari Mian Mazhari, editor of a Muslim newspaper, 
echoing a theme heard from contacts throughout the day, told 
Pol FSN, \"For India there is no immediate danger.  But, an 
insecure, unstable, non-democratic Pakistan would create all 
kinds of problems for India.\"  The Economic Times warned of 
ominous portents for India, saying \"India\'s anxiety also 
stems from its past experiences.  For the familiar reflex of 
Pakistan in the times of crisis is to increase terror 
activities in India for diverting attention.\" 
 
FM Mukherjee To Lead Delegation To Pakistan 
----- 
 
5. (C) Balasubramanian stated that while preparations are 
still being arranged, he expects FM Mukherjee to depart in 
the morning of December 29, accompanied by other senior GOI 
members, to lead an official delegation to commemorate 
Bhutto\'s passing.  He noted that it is MEA\'s understanding 
that the December 28 funeral was to be a private affair, 
therefore the GOI delegation would depart on the 29th. 
Afrasiab confirmed that he had been told by the GOI that 
Mukherjee would go on the 29th.  The Indian Express reported 
that the GOI is considering sending an all-party delegation 
as a mark of respect for Bhutto and to show support for 
Pakistani democracy aspirations. 
 
GOI Careful To Avoid Interference, Hopeful Dialogue Will

6. (SBU) The GOI is consciously avoiding any statements 
regarding the political and/or security situation in 
Pakistan, Balasubramanian said, wishing to avoid any remarks 
which could be misconstrued as interference in Pakistan\'s 
internal affairs.  He added that it is too soon to determine 
how this incident could affect ongoing confidence building 
measure talks and other dialogue, but noted such dialogue has 
survived other crises in the recent past. 
 
Embassy Contacts Suspect Musharraf, Criticize U.S. For 
Pakistan Policy 
----- 
 
7. (C) While media has been reporting the al-Qaeda claim of 
responsibility for the attack, most contacts Post spoke with 
early on December 28 believe President Musharraf had a hand 
in it.  Hard News editor Sanjay Kapoor told Pol FSN \"The 
needle of suspicion is on the General.  His crocodile tears 
on Benazir\'s killing and frequent references to the terrorist 
angle are aimed at confusing Washington about the \'real 
enemy\' of Pakistan.\"  Zaheer Mustafa, editor of an Urdu 
daily, told us \"It is quite obvious that General Musharraf\'s 
enemy attitude towards the opposition and lack of security 
for such leaders provided ample opportunities for the killers 
to organize the gruesome assassination.  One should not 
forget who benefited the most out of this killing.\" 
 
8. (C) In a front page sidebar, the Indian Express called the 
incident \"grim news\" for the United States.  Continuing with 
criticism that emerged in the media in recent days over 
accusations that U.S. military aid to Pakistan had been 
diverted to areas that could possibly be used against India, 
several contacts suggested the U.S. had been naive to support 
Musharraf.  Political commentator Zafar Agha told Post \"The 
General has gone beyond the control of the U.S. and the West. 
 He diverted U.S. help to buy arms...and went for all 
draconian measures to stop the opposition leaders and other 
challengers.\"  Interfaith Harmony Foundation Chairman Khwaja 
Iftikhar Ahmad said \"This is high time that the United States 
should focus more on Pakistan to ensure its stability and 
read into the Janus-faced General.  The media exposure about 
U.S. fund diversion really annoyed the General and the 
political vested interest in Pakistan.\" 
 
Comment

9. (C) Comment.  We suspect heightened fears in India over 
 
NEW DELHI 00005422  003 OF 003 
 
 
the threat of terrorists from Pakistan have been raised to a 
level that will not recede for the foreseeable future.  The 
shock and sympathy expressed by Indian officials in the 
immediate aftermath of the incident was sincere, but India 
will be watching its neighbor very closely in the coming 
months for signs that the leash may be slipping on 
extremists, whether on purpose or inadvertently or due to 
circumstances beyond the GOP,s control.  While Indian 
officials have tried for years to refrain from publicly 
criticizing U.S. policy on Pakistan, we expect criticism to 
rise from media and intelligentsia circles who increasingly 
perceive as naive the U.S. understanding of Pakistan 
dynamics.  For India, the primary interest at this time is a 
stable Pakistan that can control extremism.  Throughout the 
crises of 2007, India\'s backing remained with Musharraf as 
the best bet for helping Pakistan manage a soft landing.  If 
things get worse, However, or if a better prospect seems 
prudent, that support could wane.  Thankfully, Indian 
officials are so worried that they appear eager to avoid any 
controversy which could stoke the tensions stemming from this 
atrocious attack.

--------------------- 
SUMMARY 
--------------------- 
 
1.  (C) Minister of Local Government Dr. Pontso Sekatle 
requested Ambassador meet with her on October 25 to follow up on 
UN issues which had been previously discussed (see reftels). 
Specifically, Sekatle wanted the Ambassador to know that as 
Acting Foreign Minister (during FOMIN Moleleki\'s travels to 
Japan and India) she had discussed the issues of the Holocaust, 
the Iraqi Tribunal and UNESCO with Lesotho\'s Prime Minister 
Mosisili.  Sekatle and Moleleki appear to have similar positions 
and an inclination to support U.S. multilateral positions but 
for internal political sensitivities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
------------------------ 
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE AND IRAQI TRIBUNAL 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU) Concerning the Iraqi Tribunal, Dr. Sekatle relayed the 
Government of Lesotho\'s full support and affirmed its validity 
and importance at this time.  She also stated that there was 
support for the Holocaust Remembrance as requested reftel. 
During  October 28 discussion upon FOMIN Moleleki\'s return, 
Ambassador raised co-sponsorship of the holocaust resolution, 
indicating that Minister Sekatle had given assurances of the 
Government of Lesotho\'s support during Moleleki\'s absence. The 
Foreign Minister did not disagree with Dr. Sekatle\'s 
characterization, but he also did not state clearly that Lesotho 
would be a co-sponsor.  He did emphasize that the Government of 
Lesotho fully supported the principle behind the resolution, and 
the UN\'s designating an International Day of Commemoration in 
memory of the victims of the Holocaust. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
--------------- 
UNESCO CULTURAL DIVERSITY CONVENTION 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
--------------- 
 
3.  (C) As reported reftel (D) October 7, FOMIN Moleleki sent 
instructions to Ambassador Kikine, who covers Paris and Berlin, 
to support the U.S. position on cultural diversity during the 
UNESCO  meeting in Paris.  During Moleleki\'s trip to Asia, 
Acting Foreign Minister Sekatle informed Ambassador that she 
would follow up on the instructions to Lesotho\'s delegation in 
Paris.  On October 25, then-Acting Foreign Minister Sekatle told 
the Ambassador that she wanted to explain that there had been a 
breakdown in communications between Maseru and Lesotho\'s 
delegation in Paris.  Sekatle recounted the situation as one in 
which the instructions had gone from a lower level official 
within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer a statement in 
support of the U.S. position, but it did not reach the Minister 
of Education, whom Sekatle said was the delegate on the floor. 
 
4. (C) Upon his return, FOMIN Moleleki advised Ambassador on 
October 28 that the scenario had evolved somewhat differently. 
He recalled that he had given the instructions during his 
October 7 meeting in the Ambassador\'s presence to the MFA 
Officer-in-Charge of International Organizations to relay to 
Ambassador Kikine.  Acccording to Moleleki, Kikine did as he was 
instructed concerning the vote on the convention, but Minister 
of Education Tsekoa (former Minister of Foreign Affairs) had 
refused to accept direction from the current Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.  Moleleki apologized profusely for the internal 
conflict which had, in his view, thwarted the attempt to 
demonstrate support for the stated U.S. position.  This 
situation appears to be a more complex one than articulated by 
Minister Sekatle.  Moleleki implied that he would provide a 
fuller read out of the internal dynamics after a thorough 
examination of the sequence of events. 
 
-------------------- 
COMMENT 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C) There seems to be a consistency between the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Local Government in their 
desire to support the U.S. on a number of fronts in multilateral 
fora.  However, both the mechanics of communication from the 
capital to Ambassadors and/or delegation representatives appear 
flawed and is complicated by personal conflict between the 
younger set of political leaders represented by both Moleleki 
 
MASERU 00000554  002 OF 002 
 
 
and Sekatle and the older generation of leadership represented 
by Minister Tsekoa.  It should be remembered that Moleleki 
unseated Tsekoa during the government cabinet reshuffle about 
one year ago.  While optimally one would wish to see objective 
analysis and coherence of multilateral positions between GOL 
entities, it is difficult at best for this government to 
separate personal dynamics -- and perhaps adverse interactions 
-- from purely beneficial statecraft.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  RECOMMENDATION TO UPGRADE CONSULATES NUEVO LAREDO, 
MATAMOROS, AND HERMOSILLO TO CONSULATES GENERAL 
 
1.  Summary and action request:  Mission Mexico has undertaken a 
thorough review of interests, missions, workloads, and staffing 
structures at all of its consulates.  As a result we recommend that 
three posts -- Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros and Hermosillo -- be formally 
redesignated as Consulates General vice Consulates.   We have 
determined that this new status would more accurately reflect the 
posts\' current size and  responsibilities, and provide better parity 
with Mexican representation across the border in the U.S.  All three 
posts have border trade and security functions that will be better 
advanced by the Consulate General designation.  Post assesses that 
minimal costs associated with the upgrades can be absorbed in our 
existing budget.  Post anticipates no additional changes in rank and 
staffing beyond those already identified as part of anticipated 
growth in consular services (and which will proceed regardless of 
posts\' designation).  ACTION REQUEST:  Per 2 FAM 130 guidance post 
requests that, if it concurs, WHA submit the request and 
post-specific recommendations to M for approval.  End Summary 
 
NUEVO LAREDO 
 
2.  Consulate Nuevo Laredo  was established in 1871 but has grown in 
size and complexity in recent years.   For reasons of trade, 
security, consular services and staffing it is important to 
designate  Nuevo Laredo a Consulate General.  Consulate Nuevo Laredo 
sits at the hub of four border crossings through which 38 percent of 
U.S.-Mexico trade passes.    On any given day 10,000 trucks and 1200 
railcars cross the border, posing prosperity opportunities and 
security challenges.  According to one report 700 of the Fortune 
1000 top companies move raw materials or products through Nuevo 
Laredo.   On the security front, we have more American citizens 
kidnapped or missing from the Nuevo Laredo area than from any other 
city in Mexico, and our advocacy on their behalf would be 
strengthened by designating the post a Consulate General (Mexico\'s 
post in Laredo, Texas, is already a Consulate General; Mexico has 
four other posts in Texas that correspond to Nuevo Laredo\'s 
district.)    Additionally, due to the unique security challenges 
facing residents in the Laredo/Nuevo Laredo area, Post is heavily 
engaged in coordinating meetings between law enforcement entities on 
both sides of the border, in facilitating the exchange of law 
enforcement information, and also serving as a bridge to the Mexican 
military. 
 
3.   On the consular front, Nuevo Laredo has seen an NIV issuance 
increase 81% (from 36,000 to 65,300)  in just the last year, and it 
is projected to grow every year through 2012.  Passport services 
have increased an astounding 380% (from 270 to over 1,000) over the 
past year as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) comes 
into force.   It is already the second largest visa processing post 
for temporary workers headed to the US on H-2 visas. Nuevo Laredo 
oversees the  work of two constituent consular agencies.  In 
addition, due to the size of the consular district, that corresponds 
to two Mexican consulates and one Mexican Consulate General, Post 
engages in numerous public diplomacy and outreach projects that 
transcend the boundaries between the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon, 
Coahuila and Tamaulipas, including participation in numerous 
ceremonial and political events.   Finally, Nuevo Laredo\'s staff has 
increased to total 50 employees representing various agencies, and 
additional growth is slated in the coming years.  The opening of a 
DEA office in Nuevo Laredo in mid-2007 will be followed by the 
assignment of at least three additional DEA personnel to Post in 
2008 and increased law enforcement cooperation as a result. 
 
4.  Post assesses that minimal costs associated with the upgrades 
can be absorbed in our existing budget.  Post anticipates no 
additional changes in rank and staffing beyond those already 
identified as part of anticipated growth in consular services (and 
which will proceed regardless of posts\' designation.) 
 
MATAMOROS 
 
5.  Consulate Matamoros  just celebrated its 175th birthday but 
needs to upgrade its status to confront the myriad challenges it 
faces in advancing trade, promoting security, and providing consular 
services.  Since the 1994 signing of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) Consulate Matamoros\' district has become an 
important site for U.S. investment in industries exporting to the 
United States.  The average $1 billion/day in trade between the U.S. 
and Mexico poses prosperity opportunities and security challenges. 
Matamoros coordinates border liaison meetings to ensure U.S. 
interests are protected on both fronts.   On the consular front 
Matamoros has seen NIV applications increase - 30 percent in the 
past year (98,000 to 128,000), and passport applications have grown 
66 percent (288 to 480) over the same time frame.  CA projects 
additional growth in all consular services in coming years, 
including a three-fold increase in passport applications.  Consulate 
Matamoros hosts three agencies(including the recent addition of DEA) 
and has a total staff of about 70, with additional growth 
anticipated.  Consulate Matamoros oversees a constituent consular 
agency in Reynosa.  Mexico has two consulates within Texas mirroring 
Matamoros. 
 
6.   Post assesses that minimal costs associated with the upgrade 
 
MEXICO 00006281  002 OF 002 
 
 
can be absorbed in our existing budget.  Post anticipates no 
additional changes in rank and staffing beyond those already 
identified as part of anticipated growth in consular services (and 
which will proceed regardless of posts\' designation.) 
 
HERMOSILLO 
 
7.   Consulate Hermosillo in Sonora, Mexico has experienced 
geometric growth in staff and mission since its founding in 1966. 
Today its expanding business and trade promotion, law enforcement 
and consular missions mandate its designation as a Consulate 
General.  Some 212 plants in Sonora alone generate exports to the 
United States, and 42 percent of all agricultural exports to the 
United States -- most products of Sinaloa, the other state in 
Consulate Hermosillo\'s consular district -- enter through Sonora. 
Sonora state received $186 million in foreign direct investment in 
2005, and Guaymas, its fourth largest city, is the site of Mexico\'s 
fastest growing aerospace industry cluster.   The largest Ford Motor 
assembly plant in North America is in Hermosillo.  Among less 
fortunate statistics, Sinaloa is the base for the Sinaloa Cartel, 
arguably Mexico\'s most powerful drug cartel, which uses Sonora as a 
key transit area for drugs being sent illegally to the United 
States.  Sonora is also a key staging area for over 2000 illegal 
immigrants a day hoping to cross into the United States.  Hermosillo 
is Sonora\'s capital and seat of government, which facilitates access 
to Mexican authorities and gives the Consulate  an important liaison 
role for the USG with them.   While Consulate Hermosillo has seen 
only a small rise in NIV adjudications this year, it has experienced 
a significant increase in passport demand.  The Mission, however, 
has begun to transform Consulate Hermosillo into one of our largest 
H visa processing posts this year.   Consulate Hermosillo hosts five 
agencies (including two law enforcement agencies) and has a total 
staff of about 80.  Hermosillo has one constituent consular agency 
in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, where some 5000 American citizens reside. 
Hermosillo provides some support as requested to our Consulate in 
Nogales, AZ.  Mexico has five consulates in Arizona, two of them 
Consulates General (Nogales and Phoenix). 
 
8.  Post assesses that minimal costs associated with the upgrade can 
be absorbed in our existing budget.  Post anticipates no additional 
changes in rank and staffing beyond those already identified as part 
of anticipated growth in consular services (and which will proceed 
regardless of posts\' designation.) 
 
9.  Comment:  Beyond the post-specific rationales for these new 
designations we also see a benefit to demonstrating to Mexico our 
intent to improve and \"upgrade\" the bilateral relationship across 
the board at a time when our requests for closer law enforcement 
cooperation will intensify. 
 
10.  Please advise if any additional information is required.  Many 
thanks for your assistance.

ODIHR SECOND INTERIM REPORT 
--------------------------- 
 
1.  (U) ODIHR\'s second report was released on December 28 and 
notes that the campaign environment has been soured by 
allegations of use by Saakashvili of budgetary funds, unequal 
campaign conditions, intimidation, and vote buying.  OSCE 
ODIHR has received information and first hand accounts which 
indicate that some of these claims are credible.  OSCE/ODIHR 
long term observers have substantiated that some 
opposition-appointed members of the Precinct Electoral 
Commissions (PECs) were not informed about inaugural PEC 
meetings.  Initial ODIHR media monitoring indicates a lack of 
balance in the news coverage of most monitored TV stations, 
with Saakashvili generally receiving the most coverage. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
AMBASSADOR RAISES ODIHR CONCERNS WITH BURJANADZE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador Boden told Ambassadors on December 28th 
that ODHIR\'s major concerns revolve around the allegations of 
the use of intimidation during the pre-election campaign. 
Boden was recently in Telavi and saw first hand the misuse of 
administrative resources by the Deputy Governor, who is still 
driving around in his government vehicle while technically on 
leave to conduct campaign business.  Boden said that ODIHR 
has received credible information about the local police in 
Borjomi using intimidation against election commission 
officials, and about similar incidents in Raja, Gordobani, 
Telavi, and Rustavi.  The ODIHR legal analyst told the group 
the opposition doesn\'t trust the court system and feels that 
they cannot get fair court hearings.  Her analysis is that 
the local courts stretch the law to the limits in order favor 
the majority.  Ambassador subsequently raised these issues 
with Acting President Nino Burjanadze and recommended that 
she address the incidents of intimidation and see that they 
are stopped.  Burjanadze had not yet seen ODIHR\'s second 
report and seemed genuinely surprised and shocked by 
continuing allegations of intimidation.  She said that she 
had spoken firmly to governors about their responsibilities. 
She said she would raise the issue anew with Security Council 
Chief Lomaia and call the governors in the regions to get to 
the bottom of it. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SAAKASHVILI REFLECTS ON MISTAKES 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) Presidential candidate Mikheil Saakashvili was 
featured as a guest on Inga Grigolia\'s late night talk show 
on Rustavi-2 on December 27th.  Saakashvili fielded 
challenging questions from interviewers about his biggest 
mistakes.  Then, the audience members were asked the same 
question.  Below are key comments. 
 
-- Saakashvili confessed that handling Irakli Okruashvili\'s 
case was his biggest mistake during the 4-year period of his 
presidency.  Kakhi Kaladze, a wealthy and well-known Georgian 
sportsman who plays soccer for an Italian team, responded 
that he felt Saakashvili\'s biggest mistake was the handling 
of the case of Sandro Girgvliani, who was killed by police in 
a 2006 incident that became a major controversy. 
 
-- Saakashvili pointed out that he no longer needed a 
\"revolutionary team\" and therefore would plan \"a fundamental 
shift\" of his political team if he is re-elected. 
Saakashvili said he would not resort to repression against 
his political opponents. 
 
-- Saakashvili presented the priorities of his election 
program and promised that he would leave a united Georgia to 
the person who succeeded him (after Saakashvili\'s second 
term). 
 
-- Saakashvili promised that during his second term Georgia 
would become a member of NATO.  He regretfully added that 
integration into EU would not be possible during the same 
period. 
 
------------------------- 
PRIME MINISTERIAL DEBATE 
------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Inga Grigolia\'s late night television show on 
November 27th also included a second segment featuring point 
and counter-point from the current Prime Minister Lado 
Gurgenidze and two Prime Minister hopefuls, Salome 
 
TBILISI 00003179  002 OF 003 
 
 
Zourabichvili and Irakli Iashvili, New Rights Party.  The 
segment featured mainly Zourabichvili who lashed out at the 
government with accusations of voter intimidation, lack of 
access to media for opposition candidates, and refusal of the 
government to address opposition members\' concerns. 
Gurgenidze adroitly answered the accusations with specifics, 
leaving Zourabichvili ill-equipped with generalizations to 
counter the administration\'s points.  The overall impression 
from viewers we talked to was that the administration soundly 
trounced the opposition candidates on substantive issues. 
 
-------------------------- 
BODEN PREVIEWS ODIHR REPORT 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Ambassador met privately December 26 with OSCE ODIHR 
Chief Dieter Boden to discuss the current situation following 
the publication of the Patarkatsishvili coup plot tapes. 
Boden said he had met earlier in the day with Acting 
President Burjanadze to preview for her the second interim 
report which would be published by December 28.  Boden showed 
the Ambassador the current draft of key findings.  The most 
critical finding was criticism of Saakashvili for improper 
use of administrative resources.  Boden said that over the 
weekend Saakashvili had \"opened\" a new pipeline in the 
Samtskhe-Javakheti region.  He had used not only the 
Presidential helicopter, but a military helicopter 
accompanied him.  Boden said he asked Burjanadze why 
Saakashvili had opened the pipeline; wouldn\'t this have been 
more appropriate for her as Acting President.  Boden said she 
acknowledged the point, but did not have a good answer. 
Boden said he told her this kind of action will reignite the 
debate over improper use of administrative resources.  Boden 
also intended to raise this with Presidential Spokesman 
Bakradze in a meeting later in the evening. 
 
6.  (C)  Boden asked if the US intended to issue a statement 
warning against excesses after the election results were 
known.  The Ambassador reviewed what he had said to the press 
earlier in the day, and said we were finalizing an op-ed 
statement for Assistant Secretary Fried.  The ambassador said 
he was also discussing with the OSCE Rep and other 
Ambassadors a possible statement on this issue for the local 
OSCE Ambassadors to issue.  He said one needed to be careful 
with such a statement so that it was not interpreted as 
implicit support for Saakashvili.  The real problem was that 
there were some opposition leaders who are determined to 
launch post-election protests no matter what OSCE ODIHR or 
other experts say.  They have no rational goal in mind, other 
than showing their anger toward the \"hated Misha.\"  Boden 
said he was thinking about the \"January 6 problem\", saying 
that if the final report of ODIHR on the election finds that 
the process of the election went well but that there were a 
number of problems with the campaign (e.g. misuse of 
administrative resources) the opposition will use any 
criticism to try and discredit the entire process.  Boden 
noted in this regard that he had been impressed with the work 
of the new CEC Chairman and his dedication to ensuring a free 
election.   Boden clearly seemed to be already thinking 
through his final report, and how it would be received not 
just internationally but domestically in Georgia. 
 
----------------------------- 
CEC OUTLINES ITS VOTING RULES 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) CEC lawyer Archil Asanashvili briefed us December 
26 on the implications of the CEC\'s new composition (6 
opposition-appointed members, 1 from the National Movement, 
and 6 appointed by the President and Parliament) for key CEC 
decisions during the election.  He noted that the CEC is 
required to have a two-thirds majority to make certain kinds 
of decisions.  This was the case recently when the 6 
opposition members blocked a plan to organize voting for 
Georgian troops in Iraq.  (A court subsequently ordered the 
CEC to organize such voting, in order to protect the rights 
of Georgian soldiers serving abroad.)  But for most 
decisions, including the certification of results, 
announcement of preliminary results, and (with some limited 
exceptions) de-certification of any candidates, the CEC is 
able to act based on a simple majority of 7 votes. 
 
----- 
IMEDI 
----- 
 
8.  (C)  Lewis Robertson, General Manager of Imedi TV, told 
post press officer that Marty Pompadour, Executive Vice 
President of News Corp and President of News Corp Europe, had 
made the decision to shut down Imedi.   Roberston said he had 
argued that the station should not be closed as it had been 
 
TBILISI 00003179  003 OF 003 
 
 
off the air for 35 days and had fought hard to return to 
broadcasting.  With the staff defections and other threatened 
walkouts by employees, it has become problematic to produce 
newscasts.  Robertson expressed fears about what will happen 
on January 6th, wondering whether there would be violence. 
He said that Pompadour was going to announce in New York City 
that it was News Corp\'s decision to close the station. 
 
9.  (U)  Prime Minister Lado Gugenidze said that the decision 
to close Imedi was made by the owners, and not the 
government.  He expressed the hope that the channel will 
resume broadcasts soon and that Imedi staff will continue to 
work in the usual regime. 
 
---------- 
G.I.s Vote 
---------- 
 
10.  (U)  The Tbilisi Defense AttachQ Office is working with 
the Central Election Commission to airlift CEC members and 
voting materials to Georgian military members in Iraq.  The 
current plan is for CEC representatives to depart Tbilisi on 
2 January and to complete all voting in Iraq and return to 
Tbilisi on 6 January.  Currently seven members of the CEC are 
planning on making the trip; it is unclear at this point if 
opposition members will also travel.  Post is working to 
coordinate helicopter lift for the CEC members from Baghdad 
to the nine different locations where Georgian military 
members currently serve throughout Iraq. 
 
---------------------- 
Criminal Investigation 
---------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  The British Charge D\'Affaires told Ambassador that 
the Georgians are now discussing with British authorities the 
Badri Patarkatsishvili case, and specifically whether he 
could be arrested for plotting a coup from British soil. 
This question has come to light due to the Patarkatsishvili 
coup tapes, where he discusses fomenting unrest in Georgia. 
At the time of the recordings, Patarkatsishvili was both in 
Israel and the United Kingdom.  Contrary to some public 
statements otherwise, the British government did not tape any 
telephone conversations between Patarkatsishvili and others 
as it is against British law.

Israeli Airstrikes, Rocket Firing Continue 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU) Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and Palestinian rocket 
fire continue as of 1400 local on December 29.  Palestinian 
medical, UN and NGO staff report at least 280 Palestinian 
deaths and 700 injuries since airstrikes began on December 
27.  From 0001 to 1230 on December 29, Israeli airstrikes hit 
Islamic University in Gaza City, destroying a classroom 
building and student laboratory, two mosques in Gaza City and 
Jabaliya, the Hamas \"Interior Ministry\" headquarters, small 
police stations and suspected residences of Hamas leaders. 
In airstrikes overnight December 28-29, Gaza-based contacts 
report that Israeli Apache helicopters destroyed a PIJ office 
in Khan Yunis and Rafah\'s city hall.  Contacts in north Gaza 
City report Israel naval vessels fired at fishing vessels 
near Gaza\'s coastline on December 28-29, and Gaza-based 
political contacts report heavy bombing on the western edge 
of Rafah and in the Philadelfi border area. 
 
3.  (SBU) Palestinian and press contacts report that the IDF 
declared the area around the Gaza Strip and roads approaching 
Gaza crossings as a closed military zone, barring entrance to 
commercial and private vehicles, and press and diplomatic 
staff without advance IDF approval.  Gaza contacts in 
Shuja\'iya and north Gaza told PolOff early December 29 that 
they observed several IDF tanks and armored infantry vehicles 
in border areas near Karni/al-Mintar crossing and Bayt Hanun, 
while other contacts said they saw Israeli forces 
concentrated near Kerem Shalom bordering the southern Gaza 
Strip. 
 
4.  (SBU) Palestinian militants continue to fire rockets from 
Gaza, and Gaza-based contacts recorded at least 20 rocket 
launches and 2 mortars fired from northern Gaza as of 1230 on 
December 29.  At 0840, contacts report four Qassam rockets 
were fired towards Sderot.  No injuries or damage was 
reported.  At 0930, a Grad-type rocket killed one Israeli (an 
Israeli-Arab construction laborer) and injured seven others 
in Ashkelon.  Four other Grad-type rockets landed in open 
areas without causing injuries or damage.  Hamas claimed 
responsibility for the Ashkelon attacks.  At around 1050, 
three Qassam rockets landed near Sdeot Negev and three other 
rockets landed in Netivot, without causing injuries or 
reported damage.  At 1055, PIJ militants fired two mortars 
from the Shuja\'iya area, which landed near the Israeli 
military base at Nahal Oz, without causing reported injuries 
or damage.  At around 1120, the PFLP claimed to have launched 
two rockets towards Ashkelon; no injuries or damage was 
reported. 
 
West Bank Violence in 
Reaction to Gaza Airstrikes 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Israeli security forces shot and killed three 
Palestinian with live ammunition during separate 
demonstrations in Nil\'in and Silwad December 27-28.  The 
Palestinians had thrown rocks and bottles at Israeli police 
and IDF forces during the demonstrations.  Demonstrations 
continue throughout the West Bank, both spontaneous and 
organized by PLO-associated, Hamas, and National and Islamic 
Forces (NIF) groups.  In East Jerusalem, most businesses 
observed a commercial strike December 28-29.  Nearly all 
shops on the main commercial avenue of Salah al-Din Street 
were closed.  In a few demonstrations, Palestinians burned 
garbage containers and threw stones at police.  At least 
seven Palestinians were arrested in these incidents, and two 
Israeli policemen suffered minor injuries, one from a stone 
and another from being struck by a vehicle. 
 
6.  (SBU) At 0840, a Palestinian stabbed four Israelis in 
Kiryat Sefer settlement, near Modi\'in, seriously injuring two 
of them.  Israeli police shot and critical injured the 
 
JERUSALEM 00002295  002 OF 002 
 
 
assailant, and transported him to a hospital in police 
custody. 
 
Political Reactions 
------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) President Mahmud Abbas (Abu Mazen) told press 
December 28 that the PA\'s priority is to stop \"Israeli 
aggression\" and restore calm, and called on both Hamas and 
Israel to return to the ceasefire.  PM Salam Fayyad told 
press December 28 that Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip 
were \"a disaster for all Palestinian and Arabs,\" but 
criticized Hamas (and implicitly others) for inciting against 
Egypt and Arab states.  The PLO Executive Committee (ExComm) 
met at 1230 on December 29 in Ramallah to discuss the 
situation in Gaza, and the PA cabinet started its weekly 
meeting at 1100 to deliberate on PA reactions to Gaza 
violence and the security situation in the West Bank. 
 
8.  (C) Jerusalem PLC member Bernard Sabella told PolOff 
December 29 that many Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the 
West Bank are angry about the airstrikes in Gaza and 
sympathize with Hamas while it\'s under attack, but 
Palestinians in Jerusalem will not resort to violence barring 
a major \"overreaction\" by Israeli police.  Sabella said the 
common feeling is Hamas overplayed its hand and blundered by 
rejecting national dialogue in Cairo.  Jerusalem-based Deputy 
Waqf Minister Salah Zuhaykah said Hamas \"Prime Minister\" 
Ismayil Haniyah\'s comments have been \"dangerous and 
irresponsible,\" and that Hamas is sacrificing Gaza\'s people 
for its own political purposes.  However, he claimed that 
Israel has targeted non-Hamas civilians in going after police 
stations and houses, and said the poorest Gazans, not Hamas, 
are suffering the most from Israel\'s military campaign.

SUBJECT:  UNESCO - FIRST INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETING OF INTANGIBLE 
CULTURAL HERITAGE COMMITTEE CONCLUDES ON SOUTH VS NORTH DIVISIVE 
NOTE 
 
 REF: PARIS 07461 
 
1. (U) Begin Summary. The first meeting of the Inter-Governmental 
Committee (IGC) for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural 
Heritage was held in Algiers November 18-19, 2006.  The UNESCO D-G 
laid out a detailed timetable of proposed IGC and General Assembly 
meetings over the next two years that will likely set the pace for 
upcoming meetings.  The IGC had a preliminary exchange of views on 
key criteria and other issues that will ultimately govern the 
process of determining which cultural expressions are inscribed on 
the \"Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of 
Humanity.\"  China will host an extraordinary session of the IGC in 
Beijing (23-27 May 2007) and Japan will host the IGC\'s second 
regular session in early September 2007 (date still uncertain). 
Reasons for concern about an incipient North-South political divide 
have begun to appear early within the Committee.  China, India, and 
Japan have already begun to assert prominent roles in shaping the 
debate on key aspects of how the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) 
Convention is to be implemented.  The U.S. observer delegation was 
well-received by all and was one of a number of other UNESCO Member 
States not Parties to the Convention that sent observer delegations 
to this meeting.  There was wide recognition by many of the 
important role that the Smithsonian Institution and other U.S. 
cultural agencies are already playing in supporting and promoting 
intangible cultural heritage not only within the United States but 
also in other countries as well.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) In the wake of having reached its full complement of 24 
members (see reftel), the Committee held its first meeting in 
Algiers on November 18-19, 2006.  The U.S. Observer Delegation 
consisted of U.S. Mission to UNESCO Legal Adviser Michael Peay and 
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Office of International 
Relations Attorney-Adviser Michael Shapiro.  The meeting was chaired 
by Algerian Minister of Culture, Mme Khalida Toumi.  Committee 
representation was an interesting mix of both technical experts and 
professional diplomats, each group quite vocal, which resulted in a 
robust, analytical debate on most issues.   Non-States Party 
observer delegations (such as the U.S. delegation) were permitted to 
speak, upon request, without objection by States Parties, though 
such interventions were very few.  However, during the two days of 
discussions, it became increasingly clear that the Asian-Pacific 
States on the Committee (led by India and China) had caucused 
beforehand and had come prepared to use their financial muscle and 
political solidarity to play a dominant role in shaping the early 
implementation of the Convention.  By the close of the conference, 
there was considerable grumbling, particularly among European 
States, that the Asian-Pacific assertiveness and their positions on 
important substantive issues had driven an incipient North-South 
wedge between Committee members.  A recurring theme in Asian-Pacific 
States\' interventions was a sense of grievance or disappointment 
about some aspects of the World Heritage Committee process and the 
need to avoid repeating that experience on this Committee. 
 
3. (U) Key Agenda Items Addressed at Meeting.  Given the brevity of 
only two working days, the Committee moved with relative efficiency 
to address all items on its agenda, with a general understanding 
that time would permit only a preliminary exchange of views on some 
agenda items.  The key items addressed were: adoption of the 
Committee\'s Rules of Procedure; implementation operational 
guidelines; criteria for inscription on the \"Representative List\"; 
and advisory assistance to the Committee. 
 
 4. (U) Rules of Procedure.  The Committee gave in-depth 
consideration to the draft Rules of Procedure.  The UNESCO Legal 
Adviser acknowledged that the draft Rules of Procedure which the 
secretariat had prepared for the IGC were virtually identical to 
 
SIPDIS 
those used by the World Heritage Committee (WHC) (established under 
the UNESCO 1972 Convention).  However, he informed the Committee 
that it need not \"slavishly adhere\" to the WHC rules.  In line with 
that guidance, the Committee considered a number of proposed 
amendments to the draft rules, some of which were adopted.  Among 
the most important amendments adopted were those relating to Rule 20 
(rules applicable to consultative bodies), Rules 40 and 41 (secret 
ballots on IGC decisions), and Rule 43 (working languages). 
However, a proposal to amend the draft rules to change the voting 
requirement from a simple majority to a two-thirds majority 
(mirroring the WHC) failed to attract support.  At the close of the 
debate on this item, the Asian-Pacific group had gotten most of the 
changes to the rules that it had sought. 
 
5. (U) Implementation Operational Guidelines.  The 
secretariat-drafted outline that was proposed as a basis for the 
 
SIPDIS 
preparation of the Committee\'s Operational Directives for 
implementation of the Convention were found to be wanting by a 
number of IGC members and is to be revised in the light of the views 
expressed about it.  The outline became controversial and could not 
be adopted, because, in effect, it embodies contentious 
implementation issues that had not yet been taken up under separate 
agenda items. 
 
6. (U) Criteria for Inscription on the Representative List.  The 
secretariat announced at the outset that, in view of the technical 
 
SIPDIS 
expertise needed to evaluate certain ICH expressions, it will 
probably be necessary to convene an experts meeting to assist the 
committee in drawing up the inscription criteria.  (Note: in this 
regard, India intervened twice to note for the record that it is 
prepared to host such an experts meeting; India lamented the fact 
that no Indian experts had known about or participated in previous 
experts\' meetings).  The Committee considered a draft set of 10 
(ten) criteria.  There was strong Committee resistance (led by 
India\'s UNESCO Ambassador Mukherjee) to the secretariat\'s operating 
assumption that all ten criteria should be satisfied for inscription 
on the List.  A recurrent theme from a number of delegations 
representing a variety of regions was that the inscription criteria 
should not be too numerous and should be sufficiently \"flexible\" to 
enable inscription.  In view of time constraints and the divergent 
views that emerged regarding the content and quantity of inscription 
criteria, it was agreed that Committee Members and other States 
Parties to the Convention should submit their written views on the 
criteria by no later than 31 January 2007.  Observer States not 
party to the Convention (e.g., the U.S. and others) were informed 
that the submission of written views is limited to just States 
Parties to the Convention.  Among \"criteria\" issues most likely to 
be most in contention are: (i) number of criteria to be satisfied; 
(ii) rigidity vs. flexibility of criteria; inclusion, substitution, 
or elimination of contentious terms such as \"roots\", \"repetition\", 
and \"free, prior, and informed consent\"; (iii) duration of listing; 
(iv) de-listing; and (v) whether the criteria for the two lists 
(\"Representative\" and \"Needing Urgent Safeguarding\") will be 
identical. 
 
7. (U) Advisory Bodies.  Another highly contentious discussion 
ensued over the issue of advisory organizations, including their 
accreditation, and how to ensure their regional representativeness 
and comprehensiveness from a technical standpoint.  India 
energetically led the charge in urging the Committee to avoid the 
experience of the World Heritage Committee that was limited to just 
two advisory bodies that were \"overworked and understaffed.\"  What 
should the IGC do if it disagrees with a recommendation from an 
advisory body was also raised by India.  There was strong Chinese 
and other opposition (including Brazil and France to a proposed 
\"umbrella advisory body\" that would be composed of \"representatives 
of accredited NGOs and of a limited number of private persons with 
widely recognized competence in the field of ICH.\" As proposed by 
the secretariat, the umbrella body would have the power to: monitor 
implementation of the Convention; recommend safeguarding measures; 
examine reports from States; review and recommend nominations for 
inscription on the two lists (noted above); and exercise other 
unspecified powers.  As a parting shot on this issue, India took the 
floor to note that, in the World Heritage Committee context, (quote) 
\"when Western NGOs seek to collaborate with NGOs from the South, it 
often does not work and tends to lead to sharp North/South divisions 
and the impression that the North is telling the South what to do\" 
(end quote).  This statement resonated poorly with European and some 
other delegates and, at the end of the day, gave the meeting a sour 
overtone. 
 
 8. (U) The debate on advisory bodies ended with the adoption of a 
resolution in which the Committee: (a) noted that it \"wishes to be 
assisted by practitioners of ICH, NGO experts, centers of expertise 
with recognized competency in the field of ICH\"; (b) decided to 
continue consideration of whether to establish an \"umbrella advisory 
body;\" (c) requested the D-G to submit a proposal on criteria for 
accreditation of competent NGOs; and (d) invited Committee members 
and other States Parties to the ICH Convention to submit suggestions 
and proposals on these matters before 31 January 2007. 
 
9. (U) Venues/Timelines for next meetings.  At this meeting, the IGC 
began to give effect to the recommended timetable of meetings that 
was suggested by the UNESCO D-G in the opening plenary session. It 
was decided that China will host an extra-ordinary session of the 
IGC in Beijing, 23-27 May 2007, and that Japan would host the next 
regular IGC session in early September (date to be determined). 
Should there be a need for an experts\' meeting before or after 
either of those two IGC meetings, it is a virtual certainty that the 
IGC will approve India\'s proposal to host such a meeting.  Pursuant 
to the D-G\'s timetable, the first inscription of entries on the 
Representative List should take place during the Committee\'s autumn 
2008 third regular meeting.  To meet that goal, the Committee 
members (half of whom will be preparing to leave the Committee by 
that date) will have to find a higher level of consensus on key 
issues, or begin resorting to a series of contentious votes to 
resolve those issues.  Within this timetable, the D-G specifically 
noted the importance of the IGC approving operational directives, 
guidelines for accreditation of NGOs, and guidelines for financial 
assistance for submission to the 2007 General Assembly. 
 
10. (SBU) Begin Comment:  The Algiers meeting provoked unmistakable 
North vs. South tensions within the IGC\'s start-up process.  Whether 
this proves to be temporary and largely a function of the 
personalities currently leading the Asian-Pacific group on the 
Committee or becomes an enduring feature of the Committee\'s work 
remains to be seen.  What seems clear at the moment is that a sour 
political overtone has been injected into the mix that could deepen 
further during the next several meetings - to be hosted by Asian 
countries.  The Group I (European) countries and most Latin 
countries, on the other hand, have taken a less strident position 
and seem to be working toward a balance in inter-regional control 
over the implementation of this Convention.  A number of countries 
mentioned, with admiration, to U.S. observer delegation reps the 
excellent ICH work being done by the Smithsonian Institution and 
other U.S. cultural agencies, in particular, and U.S. society, in 
general.  Frequently, this observation was matched with a follow-on 
comment that it would be great if the U.S. could join the Convention 
and play an even greater role from the inside.  U.S. observer 
delegation reps were frequently asked whether the U.S. will join the 
Convention. The routine response given was that we could not predict 
what future position the U.S. will take but that we are obtaining 
firsthand information about the Convention processes as part of 
giving the Convention an overall look. 
 
11. (U) (Comment continued) Ironically, China and Japan (along with 
France, Belgium, Brazil, Nigeria, and Algeria) are among the 12 
States on the Committee selected by lot to serve only two (rather 
than four years, ending in June 2008.  They will likely attempt to 
exert their maximum influence for the remaining time of their 
tenure.  This should be coupled with the fact that some Committee 
members seem intent on ensuring that the Intangible Cultural 
Heritage Convention will give to the \"South\" the world-renowned 
cultural heritage listings that the World Heritage Convention has 
already given to the \"North.\"  In the ICH context, however, the 
South will definitely need the North\'s practical and material 
assistance to achieve their goals under this Convention.  Group I 
(largely Western European) countries will need to decide (sooner 
rather than later) whether they are willing to cede control over 
this convention entirely to the Asia-Pacific (or more generally 
\"southern\") countries, or whether they are prepared to take a more 
assertive role as insiders.  The U.S. will also need to assess its 
current position as a curious observer outside the Convention\'s 
framework, in the face of repeated questions from other delegations 
as to whether the U.S. is prepared to formally come within the 
Convention regime.  End Comment.

ENHANCED COOPERATION 
 
REF: ASHGABAT 0741 
 
Classified By: Charge Sylvia Reed Curran, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  NATO will hold a seminar on civil emergency 
planning methodology in Ashgabat, which is something of a 
breakthrough in its engagement with the Turkmen government. 
NATO\'s other Turkmen initiative, an assessment of a 
radioactive waster remediation project, is also queued up for 
implementation.  The subject of overflight clearance for a 
NATO AWACS plane is being handled bilaterally by Luxembourg 
and would not be raised as a NATO issue.  NATO has no 
illusions that the Turkmen government will be ready any time 
soon to engage more fully with the organization, but hopes 
its limited contacts will move the Turkmen to draw on 
resources offered through the Partnership for Peace.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) On September 25, NATO Liaison Officer for Central Asia 
Evan Tracz briefed representatives from NATO-member embassies 
on NATO engagement with the Turkmen government.  In 
attendance were representatives from the Turkish, German, 
French, British, Romanian and US Embassies, hosted by the 
Polish Embassy as the NATO Contact Point Embassy in Ashgabat. 
 Tracz was in Ashgabat for meetings with Turkmen government 
officials and to attend the first seminar that NATO has 
sponsored in Turkmenistan without the joint sponsorship of 
another international organization.  The two-day seminar on 
civil emergency planning methodology is to be conducted at 
the Ministry of Defense on September 28-29 with up to 30 
participants.  The seminar was proposed during the February 
visit of NATO Special Representative for the Caucasus and 
Central Asia Robert Simmons when the Turkmen side discussed 
its plan to create a Ministry of Emergency Situations and 
represents the \"soft side\" of NATO.  The seminar will be led 
by U.S. and Dutch experts, together with a NATO staffer.  It 
will focus on how governments should respond to such crises. 
Tracz shared that he had limited expectations for the event, 
but that NATO viewed it as a first step on which to build. 
 
3. (C) Regarding NATO\'s other initiative in Turkmenistan, a 
project to remediate Soviet-era radioactive waste from 
iodine and bromide plants in Hazar, Tracz said NATO\'s 
Partnership for Peace had just approved offering an 
assessment of a Russian firm\'s proposal to clean-up the 
waste.  Total cost of the assessment would be 15,000-20,000 
euros.  Tracz planned to offer the assessment to the Turkmen 
government during his meetings on this trip. 
 
4. (C) Finally, Tracz updated the embassy representatives on 
the status of the request for Turkmen overflight clearance 
for NATO Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) 
aircraft.  He said that following his last visit to Ashgabat 
(reftel), he had raised the issue of a NATO blanket 
overflight agreement with Turkmenistan at NATO headquarters. 
He was told that NATO member governments prefer to pursue 
overflight agreements with the Turkmen on a bilateral basis. 
Concerning Turkmen clearance for the Luxembourg-flagged AWACS 
planes, Tracz said Luxembourg wanted to handle the request 
bilaterally and had sent a series of incomplete and 
improperly filled out requests to the Turkmen Embassy in 
Brussels.  Each had been rejected on technical grounds 
without being forwarded to Ashgabat.  Embassy officials said 
the request would not be sent to Ashgabat until it was filled 
out correctly, otherwise they could lose their jobs.  During 
his visit, Tracz said, he would not address the AWACS 
overflight issue. 
 
5. (C) Tracz hoped the civil emergency planning seminar would 
lead to the Turkmen agreeing to participate in a NATO 
exercise, although not to actually conduct their own.  He 
said NATO has no \"grand vision\" that the Turkmen government 
would be willing to move its partnership with NATO to the 
next level.  Rather, the current goal is to induce the 
 
ASHGABAT 00001231  002 OF 002 
 
 
Turkmen to use the resources that are available to them under 
Partnership for Peace.  While NATO is aiming \"low,\" Tracz 
hoped its engagement would be thought provoking for the 
Turkmen.  Simmons will likely come to Turkmenistan in early 
2010, and that will be an opportunity for NATO to query the 
Turkmen government about a slightly more engaging follow-on 
project. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT:  Given the Turkmen government\'s steadfast 
neutrality policy, close engagement with NATO is not likely 
in the offing under current conditions.  Still, the fact that 
NATO has delivered on its proposals in 2009 and has found a 
toehold for modest engagement shows that the process of 
confidence building has begun.  NATO\'s apparent patience and 
low expectations will serve it well in what will no doubt be 
a lengthy courtship.  END COMMENT.

REF: SECSTATE 42349 
 
1. As of April 28, we are aware of one confirmed case of 
swine flu in Spain, a 23 year-old recently returned to Spain 
from Mexico.  He is hospitalized in Almansa, Albecete, and 
the press reports his condition is \"evolving favorably.\"  The 
Spanish national health service reports another 26 cases 
under investigation (four in Madrid, ten in Catalonia, and 
the rest scattered throughout the country).  There are no 
reports of human to human transmission.  Regularly scheduled 
commercial flights continue to arrive as normal from Mexico. 
Contact information is being collected from arriving 
passengers on those flights in case follow-up is required. 
The Spanish public health system, which is very capable and 
with which we have good contacts, reportedly has enough 
antivirals in stock to treat two million patients.  The 
Madrid regional government has put in place a system whereby 
those with flu-like symptoms are encouraged to stay home and 
call 112 (the Spanish 911). Healthcare workers are then 
dispatched to collect blood samples. 
 
2. Post\'s pandemic influenza working group (joined by the 
Regional Medical Manager who was here TDY for unrelated 
reasons) met April 28 to review the situation, our tripwires, 
and Embassy Health Unit procedures.  The Health Unit has 
adequate stocks of antivirals and personal protective 
equipment.  We will issue a staff notice on the situation, 
update our Embassy website, and provide Americans with links 
to the CDC and Spanish Ministry of Health websites 
(www.msc.es).  We will continue to monitor the situation in 
Spain closely and will take further additional steps as 
necessary.

REF: A. (A) 07 BOGOTA 6535 
     B. (B) 07 BOGOTA 5444 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  Colombia\'s Constitutional Court issued a 
decision overturning a controversial Forestry law for failing 
to adequately consult with \"affected\" Afro-Colombian and 
indigenous groups on the law\'s impact.  While proponents 
claimed the law strengthened sustainable forest management, 
opponents argued timber companies would use it to exploit 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous lands.  The decision will 
likely lead to challenges to other laws that impact 
Afro-Colombian or indigenous groups and fuel controversy over 
the GOC\'s consultative process.  The decision also throws the 
commercial forestry sector into disarray without an overall 
legal framework.  In response, the Uribe administration has 
introduced a new forestry law intended to have no effect on 
Afro-Colombian or indigenous lands.  END SUMMARY 
 
Court Finds Consultations Insufficient 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  On April 28 Colombia\'s Constitutional Court voided 
Colombia\'s Forestry law.  The Court held that the GOC failed 
to have \"open, frank and meaningful\" consultations with 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous groups on a government action 
that could \"affect\" them as required by International Labor 
Organization Convention 169 and Colombian law (ref A). 
Neither the Convention nor Colombian law state that the GOC 
must avoid actions that negatively affect Afro-Colombian or 
indigenous groups, but rather require a formal legal 
consultation process between the GOC and affected groups. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Afro-Colombian organizations that had opposed the 
law praised the court\'s decision.  Some political analysts 
also see a positive side to the decision.  Rafael Nieto, a 
former Vice-Minister of Justice and legal analyst, said the 
decision showed the GOC\'s increasing sensitivity to 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous issues.  Marcela Prieto, the 
head of the Institute of Political Science, told us the 
decision demonstrated the robustness of the 
checks-and-balances between the executive and judicial 
branches. 
 
4.  (SBU)  The Court\'s decision surprised Lorena Garnica, a 
special advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
Development (MinAg), who worked on drafting the law and on 
the constitutional case.  Garnica said the decision suggested 
the Constitutional Court was a \"wild card.\"  Garnica pointed 
out that the GOC held extensive consultations on the proposed 
law, including over 30 public forums with more than 2,500 
Colombians in a dozen cities around the country (28 funded by 
USAID). 
 
Sustainable Forestry Management or Uncontrolled Exploitation 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Garnica said the Forestry law, approved in April 
2006 after extensive congressional debate and input from 
environmental groups, created a stable investment environment 
for sustainable forest management.  She noted that the law 
allowed Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities, who own 
the majority of Colombia\'s 50 million hectares of forests, to 
harvest their forests themselves or contract third parties to 
manage them.  USAID provided technical assistance in 
developing the law and implementing regulations. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Still, many Afro-Colombian, indigenous and 
environmental groups complained that the law favored private 
timber companies.  Constanza Ussa, an anthropologist who 
works with Afro-Colombian and indigenous groups, said such 
groups worried that the law\'s creation of a new legal 
mechanism allowing timber companies to harvest or manage 
communally-owned forests made it easier for the companies to 
exploit them.  Afro-Colombian and indigenous groups also 
argued that the law focused on the economic aspects of 
forests to the detriment of their environmental, spiritual 
and cultural values. 
 
Decision Creates Uncertainty; Could Fuel Illegal Logging 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  The Court\'s decision will likely generate future 
lawsuits as it leaves uncertain what constitutes an adequate 
\"consultation process\" and an \"affected\" group.  Lawyers for 
indigenous groups told us they plan to challenge other laws, 
including last year\'s Rural Development law (ref B), based on 
a failure to adequately consult.  In addition, Ussa said 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous groups are likely to interpret 
the decision\'s language as support for their position that 
the GOC must avoid all actions that negatively affect them. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Garnica said the patchwork regulatory structure on 
forest management that existed prior to the Forestry law now 
returns to life.  Since the previous regulations lacked 
well-defined conservation measures and penalties, Garnica 
said the decision could increase the likelihood of illegal 
logging. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Rafael Mejia, head of the Colombian Agricultural 
Association (SAC), an umbrella association of agricultural 
producers that includes some timber companies, strongly 
criticized the court\'s decision.  Legal logging generated 
about USD 100 million per year prior to enacting the law, but 
the number began climbing in 2005 and jumped to USD 150 
million in 2006 and almost USD 200 million in 2007.  Mejia 
said the legal forestry industry was now \"on hold\" and would 
have to wait and see what happened. 
 
New Forestry Legislation in Process 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU)  The MinAg submitted a new bill on commercial 
forestry to Congress which explicitly does not apply to 
Afro-Colombian and indigenous lands.  The bill permits the 
government to offer concessions to commercially reforest 
government-owned lands.  Garnica admitted the bill, as 
submitted, does not create an overall legal framework for 
forestry or strengthen enforcement measures against illegal 
logging.  She noted however, that such measures might be 
added before it becomes law.  Garnica expects Congress to 
enact the bill prior to the end of 2008.

1.  ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 11, THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT (UNOFFICIAL 
TRANSLATION): 
 
THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA EXPRESSES ITS CONDEMNATION 
OF THE REGRETTABLE AND INHUMAN EXPLOSIONS AND ATTACKS 
WHICH OCCURRED AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK 
AND THE PENTAGON IN WASHINGTON IN THE U.S.A.  THE 
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA STRONGLY CONDEMNS ACTS SUCH AS 
THESE WHICH ARE IN CONFLICT WITH ALL RELIGIOUS VALUES 
AND SOCIAL AND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.  THE KINGDOM 
OFFERS ITS SINCERE CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THE 
VICTIMS, TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, AND TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.  THE KINGDOM REITERATES ITS 
CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACT 
ALONG WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM IN ALL OF ITS FORMS. 
 
2.  SAUDI MEDIA COVERAGE WILL BE REPORTED SEPTEL, BUT 
THE STORY DOMINATES WITH A SOMBER EDITORIAL TONE 
EXPRESSING SHOCK, GLOOM, SADNESS AND DEPRESSION. 
 
PUBLIC REACTION 
--------------- 
 
3.  MOVING ABOUT RIYADH ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER 11, 
POLOFF OBSERVED A BEEFED-UP SAG SECURITY PRESENCE, 
PARTICULARLY AROUND THE DIPLOMATIC QUARTER.  LOCAL 
STORES WERE BUSY, THOUGH FEW WESTERN EXPATS WERE 
SHOPPING.  POLOFF HAD SEVERAL CHANCE ENCOUNTERS WITH 
SAUDIS AND NON-WESTERN EXPATS, ALL OF WHOM EXPRESSED 
CONDOLENCES AND OFFERED SYMPATHY.  AN ENCOUNTER 
OUTSIDE OF A LARGE SHOPPING MALL WAS REPRESENTATIVE. 
A GROUP OF FOUR THIRTY-ISH SAUDI MALES EXPRESSED 
CONDOLENCES, THEN ONE COMMENTED THAT HE WAS CONCERNED 
ABOUT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING WHAT 
HE FELT WOULD BE AN INEVITABLE BACKLASH AGAINST ARABS 
AND MUSLIMS.  ANOTHER SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTION 
WAS UNCALLED FOR IN ANY SITUATION AND ASSERTED THAT 
\"TRUE MUSLIMS\" WOULD NOT HESITATE IN CONDEMNING THE 
ACTION.  STILL, THEY SAID, THE ONGOING INTIFADA IN THE 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES HAD CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF 
RANCOR TOWARDS THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.  THEY IMPLIED 
THAT THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED A RESPONSE TO THE 
GROWING TENSION GIVEN ALL THE WARNINGS SENT FROM THE 
ARAB WORLD ABOUT THE DETERIORATING SITUATION.  WHILE 
IN NO WAY JUSTIFYING THE ATTACKS OR SHOWING ANY 
SATISFACTION, THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR: \"WE TOLD YOU SO.\" 
 
4.  SHORTLY AFTER NEWS OF THE ATTACKS WAS BROADCAST ON 
LOCAL MEDIA, AN AMCIT EXECUTIVE AT A LARGE SAUDI 
COMPANY REPORTED THAT HIS SAUDI COLLEAGUES AND 
SUBORDINATES REACTED WITH MIXED EMOTIONS: SOME 
EXPRESSED SHOCK AND SYMPATHY, OTHERS REACTED WITH 
GRATIFICATION THAT \"AMERICA IS FEELING PAIN,\" WHILE 
STILL OTHERS VOICED CONCERN THAT THE INCIDENTS MIGHT 
SOMEHOW INTERFERE WITH THE U.S. VISA ISSUANCE PROCESS 
AND THEIR FUTURE TRAVEL TO THE U.S. 
 
5.  ANOTHER CONTACT WHO HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING 
PAN-ARAB SATELLITE VERNACULAR NEWS COVERAGE AND 
ARABIC-LANGUAGE INTERNET MESSAGE BOARDS STATED THAT 
SAUDIS AND OTHER ARABS ARE GINNING UP NUMEROUS 
CONSPIRACY THEORIES WHICH ATTRIBUTE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THE ATTACKS TO VIRTUALLY EVERYONE EXCEPT ARABS (MOSSAD 
AGENTS, MILOSEVIC-SUPPORTING YUGOSLAVS, AND UNDERLINGS 
OF A RECENTLY-EXTRADITED COLOMBIAN DRUG LORD ARE THE 
PRIME SUSPECTS).  A NUMBER OF APPARENTLY INACCURATE 
REPORTS (E.G. EXPLOSION AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, 
DELIBERATE USG SHOOT-DOWN OF AIRLINER NEAR PITTSBURGH, 
ATTACK ON CAMP DAVID) REMAIN IN CIRCULATION.  FEARS OF 
AN ANTI-ARAB/ANTI-MUSLIM BACKLASH IN THE U.S. APPEAR 
WIDESPREAD. 
 
6.  EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS CALLS AND 
E-MAIL MESSAGES FROM SAUDI, WESTERN, AND DIPLOMATIC 
COLLEAGUES EXPRESSING SHOCK AND HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES.

SUBJECT: EFCC CHAIR RIBADU SENT BACK TO SCHOOL? 
 
REF: ABUJA 2203 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Heather Merritt for reasons 1 
.4. (b & d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Nuhu Ribadu, Chairman of the Economic and 
Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been assigned to a one 
year course at the National Institute for Policy and 
Strategic Studies (NIPSS).  Speculation abounds that Ribadu\'s 
one year \"study leave\" is designed to remove him from the 
helm of the EFCC before the expiry of his four year term in 
April 2011.  However, the Inspector General of Police claims 
that Ribadu was selected for the NIPSS course based on 
seniority.  Ribadu is on loan to the EFCC from the Nigerian 
Police Force, where he was promoted to Assistant Inspector 
General in April 2007.  He has been at the helm of the EFCC 
since 2003.  The EFCC has yet to comment on the changing of 
the guard, though EFCC Secretary Emmanuel Akomaye confirms 
that he will be taking over as acting Chairman of the 
institution.  Though it is possible that it is simply 
Ribadu\'s turn to attend a relatively prestigious training 
course, it seems likely that his agency\'s vigor in 
investigating powerful people had some impact on the timing 
of his NIPSS assignment.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Nigeria\'s Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mike 
Okiro announced at an Abuja press conference December 27 that 
Nuhu Ribadu, Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes 
Commission (EFCC) has been selected to attend a one year 
course at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic 
Studies (NIPSS).  Okiro said that attendence at NIPSS was 
\"routine for senior officers\" and that sending Ribadu to the 
course would be good for him and for the police force.  The 
EFCC has not yet publicly commented on Ribadu\'s new 
assignment.  According to colleagues from the British High 
Commission, Emmanuel Akomaye, the EFCC Secretary (effectively 
Ribadu\'s #2), confirmed December 28 that he will be taking 
over soon as acting EFCC Chairman and said that had known 
Ribadu was going to NIPSS for \"some time.\" 
 
3.  (U) NIPSS is a Nigerian government training institution 
roughly equivalent to a U.S. war college (reftel).  Sixty 
senior military officials and civil servants are chosen each 
year to attend a 10-month training course at the institute. 
Alumni of NIPSS include the current Sultan of Sokoto, several 
former heads of state, and numerous ministers and other high 
ranking officials. 
 
4.  (U) Nuhu Ribadu came to the EFCC from the Nigerian Police 
Force, where he holds the rank of Assistant Inspector 
General.  Though Ribadu remains a police officer, he has 
independent statutory powers as Chairman of the EFCC, so it 
is not clear whether the IGP, though technically his 
commanding officer, can simply reassign him to NIPSS like any 
other member of the police force.  Ribadu has been at the 
helm of the EFCC since 2003, and he was re-appointed as EFCC 
Chairman by former President Obasanjo in April 2007.  The 
EFCC Act (2004) grants him a four-year term of office, unless 
he is removed by the President for inability to discharge his 
office, incompetence, or \"if the President is satisfied that 
it is not in the interest of the Commission or the public\" 
that he should remain in office. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  Most press accounts speculate that Ribadu is 
being sent to NIPSS now in order to remove him prematurely 
from the EFCC, perhaps due to ongoing institutional battles 
between the EFCC and the Attorney General on actions against 
former governors.  The EFCC has been active in recent weeks, 
jailing former Governors Ibori (Delta State) and Fayose 
(Ekiti State) pending trials, investigating allegations of 
corruption against Senator Iyabo Obasanjo (daughter of the 
ex-President), and reportedly preparing to indict another 
four ex-governors soon.  Though it is possible that it is 
simply Ribadu\'s turn to attend a relatively prestigious 
training course, it seems likely that his agency\'s vigor in 
investigating powerful people had some impact on the timing 
of his NIPSS assignment. Embassy has already requested an 
anytime meeting for Ambassador with Ribadu and has calls in 
to the Foreign Minister and for the President, though both 
are out of Abuja at their respective villages.  End Comment.

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio reported that on Sunday the diplomatic-security cabinet 
adopted PM Ehud Olmert\'s view that the cease-fire must be 
reinforced.  Ha\'aretz cited the cabinet\'s decision that the IDF will 
no longer arrest Palestinians in the West Bank without explicit 
approval from either the OC Central Command or the commander of IDF 
forces in the territories.  Ha\'aretz and other media also reported 
that the cabinet urged stricter rules of engagement in the Gaza 
Strip.  Maariv reported that contrary to Olmert and FM Tzipi Livni, 
Defense Minister Amir Peretz approves the IDF\'s stance that Qassam 
rocket fire must be countered.  Yediot reported that the army is 
reducing its activity in the West Bank. 
 
On Sunday most media emphasized Israel\'s concerns about the 
possibility of a coup in Lebanon.  On Sunday Yediot wrote that 
Israeli officials have believed for a long time that Iran and Syria 
have set themselves the goal of overthrowing Fouad Siniora\'s 
government at any price.  Today marks the fourth day of the peaceful 
siege of Siniora\'s office by thousands of demonstrators, with 
Hizbullah a dominant force among them.  Media reported on some 
violent incidents between Shi\'ites and Sunnis, in which a young 
Shi\'ite man was shot to death on Sunday.  The Jerusalem Post 
reported that the latter have begun to rally behind Siniora.  Yediot 
reported that FM Livni told her colleagues not to publicly support 
Siniora.  The Jerusalem Post reported that long-range missiles and 
truckloads of advanced anti-tank missiles from Iran and Syria have 
been smuggled to Hizbullah in Lebanon over the past four months. 
Leading media reported that on Sunday the security cabinet adopted 
the defense establishment\'s recommendation to withdraw IDF soldiers 
from the Lebanese side of Ghajar, a village straddling the border 
between the two countries.  In place of the IDF troops, UN 
peacekeepers would be deployed. 
 
The media reported that over the weekend several Qassam rockets were 
fired at Israel from the northern Gaza Strip.  The IDF did not 
respond.  Israel Radio reported that this morning an Israeli man was 
stabbed in the West Bank village of Bidya. 
 
On Sunday The Jerusalem Post quoted EU foreign policy chief Javier 
Solana as saying on Saturday that Hamas has squandered an 
opportunity to end the international sanction imposed on the PA. 
Israel Radio quoted a senior Egyptian source as saying in an 
interview with the London-based Al-Hayat that there is a wide gap 
between the positions of Israel and Hamas regarding the issue of 
abducted IDF soldier Cpl. Gilad Shalit. 
 
On Sunday Maariv reported that FM Livni is examining an EU proposal 
to form an armed multi-national force that will be deployed in the 
Gaza Strip and will operate in a format similar to the one used by 
UNIFIL in southern Lebanon today.  The newspaper said that Olmert is 
currently inclined to oppose the idea. 
 
Over the weekend various media cited The Sunday Times of London as 
saying that Olmert will soon meet soon with officials in Riyadh in 
order to establish a peace treaty between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 
According to the report, Olmert met last September with Prince 
Bandar bin-Sultan, who is considered to be of King Abdullah\'s close 
advisers. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that last week in Athens Deputy Defense Minister 
Ephraim Sneh (Labor Party) and a number of other defense-related 
personalities participated in an international seminar on the Middle 
East alongside Lebanese and Syrians.  This was the first time Sneh 
participated in such an event in his current capacity. 
 
Leading media reported that the GOI\'s anti-terror HQ has warned 
Israelis not to stay in the Sinai.  The advisory follows an 
announcement by the Egyptian government that four Palestinian 
terrorists are roaming the area with a view to attacks Israelis. 
 
Over the weekend the media reported that the UN General Assembly 
passed a resolution  on Friday calling for the withdrawing of Israel 
from the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. 
 The resolution passed by a large majority of 157.   Seven countries 
voted against: Israel, the US, Australia, the Marshall Islands, 
Micronesia, Nauru, and Palau.  Ten members abstained. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Israel will not cooperate with a UN 
fact-finding mission to investigate last month\'s botched IDF 
shelling in the Gaza Strip that killed 19 people, but will not bar 
entry into the country to the mission\'s head, South African Nobel 
Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu. 
 
On Sunday Hatzofe reported that Iranian President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad spoke skeptically over the course of the weekend about 
Israel\'s ability to continue to exist.  In the course of a meeting 
between Ahmadinejad and Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh in 
Doha, Qatar, the Iranian President said that the entire world knew 
that Israel had been planted in the Middle East in order to 
strengthen the hegemony of the colonialist countries and their 
control over the Islamic world.  Hatzofe reported that Haniyeh 
thanked the Iranian government for its support on Palestine, and 
said that the popular Palestinian Intifada would continue until the 
occupation was lifted and Jerusalem was liberated. 
 
On Sunday leading media reported that, in its first detailed 
response to the Peace Now report that alleged that 40 percent of the 
lands of the West Bank settlements are privately owned Palestinian 
lands, the Council of Jewish Settlements in the Territories said 
that the report was an act of  \"fraud and deceit by means of which 
Peace Now tried to trick Israeli society and the international 
community in order to create pressure for a full withdrawal from the 
areas that Israel liberated in the Six-Day War.\" 
 
Outgoing Israeli Ambassador to the US Daniel Ayalon was quoted as 
saying in any interview with Globes that Israel should give 
preferential treatment to US products such as Boeing aircraft. 
Ayalon also said that the Residence of the Israeli Ambassador in 
Washington should be demolished and replaced with a building 
corresponding to the needs of the 21st century. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that on Sunday the GOI unanimously approved the 
establishment of a Ministry of Strategic Affairs, even though AG 
Menachem Mazuz wrote a legal opinion in which he points out that the 
authority of the office is ambiguous.  Avigdor Lieberman has been in 
charge of the office. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that the Israeli-Arab community is demanding the 
return to villages abandoned in 1948.  The newspaper cited other 
demands, such as the modification of Israel\'s national flag and 
anthem.  The newspaper reported on the role of the NGO The Mossawa 
Center - The Advocacy Center for Arab Citizens in Israel, in this 
development. 
 
Ha\'aretz reported that former Defense Ministry counsel and Mossad 
staffer Harold Katz has filed a USD 500,000 suit against the state 
in Jerusalem District Court.  According to the attorney, the state 
prevented his travel to the US to recoup moneys seized by 
authorities there, due to concerns he would be interrogated 
regarding his role in the Jonathan Pollard affair. 
 
Yediot reported that the low rate of the US dollar on the Israeli 
markets has created a crisis in real estate in the country. 
 
The Jerusalem Post ran a Jewish Telegraphic Agency feature about 
General Motors\' alleged collaboration with Nazi Germany.

Syria\'s takeover of Lebanon], since the fall of Siniora will mark 
the end of its adventure in Lebanon and will also mark the path to

The independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized: \"It would be

I.  \"Israel Will Pay the Price\" 
 
Professor Eyal Zisser, the Chairman of the Department of Middle 
Eastern History at Tel Aviv University and a senior expert on Syrian 
and Lebanese affairs, wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot (12/3): \"At this stage, Nasrallah will settle for 
Siniora\'s acquiescence to some of his demands, the principal one of 
which is the establishment of a new government in which Nasrallah 
and his allies in the Shi\'ite camp will have influence and the right 
to veto every decision.  This is Nasrallah\'s goal for now, since in 
the long term he has wanted to rule Lebanon for a long time since 
the Shi\'ite community is the largest in the country.  But Nasrallah 
has patience, and he is willing to wait until conditions are ripe 
for the big move.  Prime Minister Siniora is behaving with 
extraordinary courage right now in the face of Nasrallah\'s 
threatening display.... [However], if the supporters of Syria indeed 
regain control of Lebanon, those who will pay the price will be 
those same courageous Lebanese who hoped that Lebanon would embark 
on the path of democracy and liberty.  The next to pay the price 
will be Israel, which will discover that while it succeeded in 
driving Hizbullah away from the northern border, it has gotten it as 
the kingmaker of Lebanese politics and of the next government in 
Beirut.  In the end, the United States will also pay the price, 
since the fall of Siniora will mark the end of its adventure in 
Lebanon and will also mark the path to the Americans\' preparing to 
leave Iraq and the end of President Bush\'s vision of a new Middle 
East.\" 
 
II.  \"A Test of Strength in Lebanon\" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha\'aretz editorialized (12/3): \"The 
demonstrations launched by Hizbullah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah 
in Beirut are meant to topple Fouad Siniora\'s elected government and 
replace it with a new one.  The immediate pretext was the Siniora 
government\'s approval of a resolution to establish an international 
tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of Rafiq 
Hariri in February 2005.... But it seems that the argument over the 
tribunal is merely serving as a launching pad for Nasrallah\'s 
political ambitions.... This is a situation in which the 
international community, which mobilized quickly to adopt 
Resolutions 1559 and 1701, cannot behave as a mere bystander, 
watching as the progress achieved in Lebanon is blown to bits.  The 
Siniora government currently needs more than declarations of 
support.  A meeting of donor states, which would help the Lebanese 
government to extricate itself from the economic crisis that 
engulfed it after the war, is an urgent necessity.  At the same 
time, it would be wise to move forward on an Israeli withdrawal from 
Sheba Farms, which would grant the Siniora government a diplomatic 
achievement.  And more important than either of these is the 
conducting of effective negotiations with Syria, whose goal would be 
to remove Syria\'s label as an \'evil state\' that supports terror in 
exchange for its keeping its hands off Lebanon, completely and 
permanently.  This is a task of the greatest importance if the 
international community, the region and Israel do not wish to see 
the start of another local war.\"

Summary:

Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv: \"There are some situations in which you have to grit your 
teeth, close your eyes, plug your ears and employ restraint.  We are 
in the middle of such a situation.\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz: \"The urgent need to bolster a coalition of 
pragmatists, lend added importance to a settlement with the 
Palestinians.  This is a wonderful opportunity to hold Olmert to his 
word.\" 
 
Former US Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot: \"The most urgent issue facing the United States and Israel 
... is whether they can find common ground with [the moderate] Arab 
countries, which are threatened by Iran\'s move to achieve regional 
hegemony.\" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: \"If we 
don\'t try [to counter the anti-Israeli mood around the world], 
nothing will improve and Israel will have an increasingly hard time 
winning acceptance, attracting tourism, selling its products, 
conducting scientific research or engaging in cultural dialogue -- 
in short, keeping its rightful place among the family of nations.\"

I.  \"Grit Our Teeth\" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (12/4): \"There are some situations in which you have to grit 
your teeth, close your eyes, plug your ears and employ restraint. 
We are in the middle of such a situation.... Anyone who heard Javier 
Solana, Condoleezza Rice, the foreign ministers of Germany and 
Austria praising Israel\'s restraint, realize that sometimes you have 
to deposit some credit in the bank, instead of spending it. 
Therefore, better not to use aspirin against terror now, so that we 
can perform emergency surgery, in field conditions, with a lot of 
blood and tension, later on.  That\'s the truth.  Why will there 
apparently be a military operation in Gaza?  Because there is no 
other choice.  Why must we not agree to a cease-fire in the West 
Bank?  Because a month afterwards Qassam rockets will start falling 
on Kfar Sava.  The figures show, clearly, that Hamas has made a 
strategic decision to link up with Iran, to assimilate completely 
the Iranian strategy and become an obedient branch of the 
Revolutionary Guards on our doorstep.  Since the American pressure 
started, with the closing of the Saudi charity and the international 
siege, Iran has become Hamas\'s number one fund provider.  Hamas 
members go to Iran, train, and return to Gaza through Egypt with 
instructions, with new abilities and with plans.  In Judea and 
Samaria [i.e. the West Bank], the Hamas infrastructure has been 
smashed.  Any break in IDF activity there would link Hamas\'s \'land 
of ability\' in Gaza with the \'land of possibility\' in the West Bank. 
 This would be a fatal link that would turn central Israel into a 
battlefield.  And therefore, we cannot allow this to happen.  And 
therefore, we have to employ a little restraint right now. For 
later.\" 
 
II.  \"Hold Olmert to His Word\" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha\'aretz (12/4): \"If there is any credibility to 
Olmert\'s words, then the man who rebelled against his leader, 
Menachem Begin, and who opposed the first Camp David agreement, has 
undergone a major ideological revolution.... It is possible that... 
the words were all talk and spin.  It is possible that the Sde Boker 
address was aimed at the ears of the gentile George Bush, and of the 
gentiles in Europe.... [Whatever the case may be], the growing 
threat of the spread of radical Islam in the Middle East and the 
urgent need to bolster a coalition of pragmatists, lend added 
importance to a settlement with the Palestinians.  This is a 
wonderful opportunity to hold Olmert to his word.\" 
 
III.  \"Facing a Piping Hot Middle East\" 
 
Former US Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk wrote in Yediot Aharonot 
(12/4): \"In his speech at the remembrance ceremony for David 
Ben-Gurion, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered the Palestinians an 
olive leaf.  But the address also contained another, less 
conspicuous but more important peace proposal: an offer to the Arab 
states, which he invited as full partners with Israel and the 
Palestinians in making peace, based on the \'positive\' details in the 
2002 Saudi peace plan.... The most urgent issue facing the United 
States and Israel ... is whether they can find common ground with 
[the moderate] Arab countries, which are threatened by Iran\'s move 
to achieve regional hegemony.  This will be the focus of discussions 
next week in Washington at the Saban Forum between senior American 
and Israelis officials and experts.  This is also the context in 
which Olmert\'s offer to the Arab countries should be understood. 
The only effective strategy facing the Iran-Syria-Hizbullah axis is 
the construction of an alliance of moderate countries and leaders 
that have similar views, and which would include the US, Israel and 
those Arab states.\" 
 
IV.  \"Branding Israel\" 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (12/4): 
\"Like corporate products, nations too can be regarded as brand-names 
and their standing in the international marketplace evaluated 
according to a wide range of criteria.  That is what the Anholt 
Nation Brands Index does four times annually for 36 nations. This 
time Israel too was tested and it came a cropper -- last among the 
36 and close to rock-bottom in all categories examined.... Though 
the odds undeniably weigh heavily against Israel, given how long we 
have neglected the task, there is no excuse for failing to mount a 
spirited counter-offensive.... Anholt predicts that even the 
cleverest counter-offensive may take 30 years to yield tangible 
results. Perhaps, but we can at least try for a quicker turnaround. 
One thing is certain: If we don\'t try, nothing will improve and 
Israel will have an increasingly hard time winning acceptance, 
attracting tourism, selling its products, conducting scientific 
research or engaging in cultural dialogue -- in short, keeping its 
rightful place among the family of nations.\"
